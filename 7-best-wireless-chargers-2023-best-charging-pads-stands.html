Most recent smartphone models do support wireless charging, but you should check the specifics of your model before investing in a wireless charger. Compatible phones are usually marked with “Qi wireless charging” or simply “wireless charging”.</p><p>You’ll also need to ensure that the wireless charger you’re interested in is compatible with your smartphone model.</p><h3><b id=U83752444531McF>Is wireless charging bad for your phone?</b></h3><p>Any form of charging will wear your battery out over time, but wireless charging shouldn’t be any more harmful to your device than standard wired charging. While it is true that wireless charging generates more heat than wired charging, which can put more strain on the battery, both your charger and smartphone should be designed to manage this effectively.</p><p>To ensure heat doesn’t exceed safe limits, it’s a good idea to invest in a wireless charger from a reputable brand which includes safety features like temperature protection.</p><h3><b id=U837524445311fG>Can I charge my phone wirelessly if I have a case?</b></h3><p>Most phone cases can be used with wireless charging, as long as they aren’t too thick. You can also buy specific phones cases, such as <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>MagSafe-enabled cases for iPhone</a>, to ensure they’ll work with a compatible charger.</p><p><b>More best tech accessories</b></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p><a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=bfda272d1940670c088e4b9365870792 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best portable chargers and power banks</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a8e291f07c40719a9f44da8cf4eb8d2b data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best laptop bags</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=2cf950e02db98d3d2944c15072df415a data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best laptop stands and holders</a></p><p>Originally published as <a class=body-link href=#>7 best wireless chargers you can buy in 2023</a></p><a class=author-content_image href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/resources.news.com.au/author-profiles/eecaf49b-f91e-4f16-a741-42d0b131297a.png width=64 height=64 alt="Lauren Chaplin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a class="author-content_name g_font-title-s" href=# data-tgev=event10 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-label="Lauren Chaplin" data-tgev-container=author-all>Lauren Chaplin</a><span class=author-content_title>Consumer Technology Writer</span><p class="g_font-body-s author-content_bio">Lauren is a consumer tech expert with five years’ experience in reviewing and writing about laptops, mobile phones, headphones, televisions and all the gadgets that make our lives easier.
