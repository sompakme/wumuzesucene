This did not turn out the way NWA had hoped as it only gave the company a lot of bad publicity, with reports noting the whole angle cost NWA a deal with The CW. That said, NWA Powerrr has now found a new home on the CW app amid reports of them losing the TV deal.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously reported that the NWA may have tainted their deal with the CW over that cocaine spot</a>&nbsp;at the NWA’s recent PPV event, Samhain. It was then announced that the CW would become NXT’s home from next year, due to which Billy Cogan got criticized by fans and pro wrestlers alike, especially&nbsp;<a href=#>Eric Bischoff</a>.</p><p>Interestingly enough, if fans browse the CW app, <a href=#>they will find that NWA Powerrr is currently available there</a>. For the time being, only eight episodes of the series’ 15th season are available for streaming, listed in the “Recently Added” section.</p><p>That said, the <a href=#>NWA is expected to get roster as well as production cuts in the future</a>. Billy Corgan&nbsp;<a href=#>doubled down on the NWA landing TV deal with top 20 network</a>&nbsp;recently as well. Regardless, we’ll have to wait and see what will become of NWA in the end.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on this story?
