This hurts. You left us too soon. You taught me so much. I will be forever grateful for the experience of knowing you. Thank you for your wisdom, your advice, your kindness and your friendship. Deepest condolences to your wife and family in this difficult time. You showed me what a life well lived looks like. Rest In Peace, Andre. I love you, man.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Actress and co-star Melissa Fumero, shared a lengthy message on Instagram featuring an image of her Braugher on a doc off the ocean in Malibu. “I will remember all the advice you gave me. I will remember all the times we laughed because your laugh was one of the all time greatest laughs to have ever existed. I will remember the deep love and loyalty you had for your family. I will remember it every time I ask work to make time for me to be with my family. I will remember how you sent me pictures of Fall trees in NJ because you knew how much I missed that time of year back east. I will remember you calling me Melly Fumé. I will remember so much. I really thought I’d see you again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Peretti, Miller and Blocker also starred alongside Braugher in the Fox-NBC sitcom. Peretti wrote on social media, “Love you Will miss your dulcet tones. Forever lucky to have gone on such a journey with you. Ringside seat. You were so funny to me and the epitome of still waters run deep. I will always cherish our conversations, often with me hanging in your doorway barring your exit, and the insane opportunity to be your sidekick. Is it weird that I am also grieving for what Captain Holt meant to Gina? I really hoped and knew I would see you again. Hate that I won’t.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Miller shared on Instagram, “An actor prepares… Sending love to Andre’s family and friends and all of us who had the honor of working with him.&nbsp;#brooklyn99.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Blocker wrote in a tribute, “Fiercely intelligent, remarkably kind, supportive, generous and possessed a deep and extraordinary talent, and had even more to offer. I am devastated. I love him. The 9 years I was able to work with him and to just be in his presence was truly a blessing. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Diamond starred alongside Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and wrote in a statement shared with THR, “Andre was an inspiration as a man, and as an actor. As a first year student at Juilliard, I was plunked into a spear carrying role in his fourth-year production of Othello. His performance in the title role was astounding, and I marveled at it every night. Several years later I followed him onto Homicide, and like everyone else, was blown away by his power and talent. But, honestly what I most remember,&nbsp; and have always tried to emulate, was who he was as a father and as a husband. He always seemed to have what was most important in this life figured out. A tremendous loss. My deepest condolences and most heartfelt love to his family.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kyle Secor, another co-star from Braugher’s Homocide days, told THR in a statement, “How lucky was anyone who knew Andre. A force of nature; intelligent, wise, funny, and compassionate with a deep sense of integrity. He got my young head right more than a few times about what was important in this world. He was also the best acting partner you could ask for, a fine friend and unselfish collaborator. He made everyone on the set better and was humble in his genius. My condolences to his wife Ami and his sons, his family, friends and many fans who are in shock by his departing the stage far too soon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lucas, who starred in 2006’s Poseidon with Braugher, shared in a sweet message: “The great Andre Braugher passed away today. He was one of the first actors I ever worked with. And years later we did Poseidon together. I saw him perform Shakespeare in the Park and it was beyond memorable. It was an early preview and towards the end during his monologue as Henry V he just stopped. Dead stop. Silence. He put his head down and clearly we all realize he had forgotten his lines. The pause lasted what seemed an eternity and then like lightning he whipped his head up and exploded with greatness, word perfect. It was a performance I will always remember. He was an actor and man I always deeply respect. Rest in Peace Andre.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Simon, author of Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, which inspired NBC’s&nbsp;Homicide: Life on the Street, shared, “Andre Braugher. God. I’ve worked with a lot of wonderful actors. I’ll never work with one better. Stunned and thinking of Ami and his sons and so many memories of this good man that are now a blessing. But too damn soon.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Snowfall actor Amin Joseph wrote on X, formerly Twitter, “Andre Braugher set the standard – a phenomenal man both on and off the screen. Inside the frame he was that of an absolute beast, while off-camera, he was a giving teacher and a true legend. His respect and humility were infectious, inspiring us to be better people and actors.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Royce, who co-created Men of a Certain Age, which Braugher starred in, paid tribute to the actor, writing, “This is impossible for me to process. He was best actor in the world. An incredible human being. An incomprehensible loss.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Screenwriter Steven Canals wrote on social media, “Andre Braugher was a megawatt talent. Reliable, dependable, emotional. Whenever he was part of a cast I knew it meant the show would be great. Rest well, sir.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Andre Braugher was the actor that others in the profession would always aspire to be,” NBC/Universal Television, which aired/produced Brooklyn Nine-Nine, shared in a statement. “He infused Det. Frank Pembleton on ‘Homicide: Life on the Street’ with both righteous ferocity and quiet dignity. In addition to his prowess as a dramatic actor, his comedy chops were also on full display as the determined and passionate Capt. Holt in Brooklyn Nine-Nine. His performances will continue to inspire future generations and we will miss him tremendously.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Fox, which aired the first five seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, shared with THR, “Everyone at FOX is devastated by the sudden loss of our friend and colleague, the incredibly talented Andre Braugher. He will most certainly be remembered for his iconic comedic and dramatic roles across both film and television, but he will be remembered mostly for his big heart, kindness and the lasting impact he made on his friends, family and fans everywhere. Andre was the heart and soul of the Nine-Nine and will forever be our Captain. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Andre’s family and loved ones at this time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Read more tributes below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Andre Braugher.
