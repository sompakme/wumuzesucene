</strong>2024-07-24</div><p><span>Joe Mixon is widely known as a running back who has played for the Oklahoma Sooners.&nbsp;He was a talented 5 star recruit considered the top pick by sports tabloids and ranking websites.&nbsp;However, after a series of debates and questions about his character, he was selected in the second round of the 2017 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.&nbsp;Through June 2017, he signed a 4-year contract with the Bengals worth $5.45M with a $2.81M guarantee and a $2.10M signing bonus.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Joe Mixon’s biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>He

amassed 1,443 rushing yards and 21 touchdowns on 201 carries and gracefully finished his senior year with 1,704 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns on 226 carries.</span></p><p><span>His basketball

and win 10-0 in the league that season.</span></p><p><span>Upon graduation, he was courted by 47 colleges including UCLA, Alabama, etc. from which he selected Oklahoma University and played for the

camera by Amelia Molitor, resulting in the team’s one-year suspension.&nbsp;When he came back the next season, he had a 76-yard touchdown reception that ranks as one of the longest ever caught by a freshman running back for the Sooners.</span></p><p><span>He went on to record his highest score ever for The Sooners with 31 bringing 263 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns, with 4 receptions for 114 receiving yards and 3 receiving touchdowns he earned in the game against Texas Tech.&nbsp;He also contributed to his team’s victory in the Sugar Bowl, with 91 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, five receptions and 89 yards in the game against Auburn.</span></p><p><span>Professionally, Joe Mixon was drafted 48th overall in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL draft, despite not initially

surgery.</span></p><p><span>He was serving a one-year sentence of 100 hours of community service and was made to undergo behavioral counseling sessions.&nbsp;He was fined $1,200 and suspended for an
