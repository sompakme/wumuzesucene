Moreover, fans apparently unearthed an old Google Maps image of his hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana that supposedly shows him as a 13-year-old. It's unclear exactly how fans came to this conclusion, although a likely theory is that they did the math and found that this photo's date lined up with when the rapper was 13 years old. This hasn't been confirmed, though. Alas, it wouldn't be the first time something like this happened in recent memory, as fans also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">questioned a family Easter pic</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, it just goes to show that YoungBoy's hold on his fanbase is quite powerful, and that they will always bring him to the forefront of rap conversations based on even the slightest speculation. What's more is that he's got a lot to promote these days, such as his recent album. For example, the I Rest My Case spitter recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">unveiled "Gravedigger Mountain" billboards in Utah</a>, pointing to another prompt release of new material on the way, plus promotion of what he already dropped this year. In fact, we already have confirmation from him that there's another full-length arriving very soon.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nba-youngboy-supposedly-pictured-in-old-google-maps-image-at-age-13>NBA YoungBoy Supposedly Pictured In Old Google Maps Image At Age 13</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YoungBoy's next album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I Just Got A Lot On My Shoulders</a>, will come out at some point this year. As such, this would continue this prolific streak of project releases that absolutely flooded the 2010s and 2020s so far. Not only that, but with this frequent activity in mind, we wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't his last 2024 effort. Time will tell, but we know that the same fans going wild over this Google Maps image will be happy to indulge.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, do you think that this is actually a picture of the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Catch Him</a>" MC as a young lad or is this a wild reach?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbYF6g5NmsKitnpyvsMWMoKaon5yaeq6tz6xkamtdrrKivtJmpqWcXZ22sXnHqKdmppWswA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
