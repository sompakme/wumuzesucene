She didn't share any details pertaining to his case but she did call for his freedom while sharing her disappointment in people who've been cracking jokes and sharing memes about the situation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It's a damn shame when we live in a world where people thrive off and feed negative energy..&nbsp;laugh at others who are going through real life challenges, fighting for their lives & freedom... sick of it!

Earlier today, footage of his mother speaking in a British accent emerged which further proved ICE's claim that he's a native of the U.K. Shortly after the video surfaced,&nbsp;his alleged birth certificate emerged which confirmed that he was born in London and lived there until he was 12-years-old before moving to Atlanta.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
