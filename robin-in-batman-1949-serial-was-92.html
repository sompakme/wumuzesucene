He appeared opposite Robert Lowery as the <span data-scayt_word=Caped data-scaytid=8>Caped</span> Crusader/Bruce Wayne, and they battled the black-hooded criminal The Wizard in the series that took three months to make and typically played for young audiences on Saturday mornings and afternoons.</p><p>Batman co-creator Bob Kane had wanted a 16-year-old actor to play Robin, but producer Sam <span data-scayt_word=Katzman data-scaytid=11>Katzman</span> at Columbia thought Duncan would be perfect for the role — even though he was 26 at the time.</p><p>“[Kane] said, ‘Oh, no, I don’t want a guy 26 years old; you know, that’s as old as Batman,’ ” Duncan recalled in a very entertaining 2005 <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>. “So anyway, they looked at, gosh, kids and kids and kids and kids, and finally they couldn’t find anybody — Kane didn’t like ’em, so Sam called me and says, ‘Hey, John, you know, wear some jeans or <span data-scayt_word=somethin’ data-scaytid=12>somethin’</span> and a sweater and look as young as you can and, for God sakes, don’t comb your hair. Just come on over.’ So I did. And so when I walked in the door, before I was even introduced, Kane says, ‘Hey, that’s Robin.’ So that’s how I got the part.”</p><p>A native of <span data-scayt_word=Gower data-scaytid=16>Gower</span>, Mo., near Kansas City, Duncan learned how to tap dance at an early age and toured with acts that included The Will <span data-scayt_word=Mastin data-scaytid=17>Mastin</span> Trio, which featured Sammy Davis <span data-scayt_word=Jr data-scaytid=18>Jr</span>. and his father. He was discovered by a <span data-scayt_word=20th data-scaytid=19>20th</span> Century Fox talent scout, and he and his whole family packed up and drove west to Hollywood.</p><p>He danced in nightclubs on Hollywood Boulevard, and that’s where he met Turner, then a teenager.</p><p>In one of his first movies, Duncan played a sailor in the Bogart film Action in the North Atlantic (1943), and he became good friends with the star.</p><p>“Bogey was a great guy,” he said. “He was a little guy like Jimmy <span data-scayt_word=Cagney data-scaytid=20>Cagney</span>, and Bogart and Alan Ladd and all of us were very good friends. We partied together with their wives, and when a part in a picture or something would come up for a little guy, why, usually I’d get it.”</p><p>Bogart later gave him a job as another sailor in The <span data-scayt_word=Caine data-scaytid=23>Caine</span> Mutiny (1954).</p><p>Duncan also played the title role in The Million Dollar Kid (1944), one of several movies he made with The Bowery Boys/East Side Kids.</p><p>His last film was <span data-scayt_word=Spartacus data-scaytid=24>Spartacus</span> (1960).</p><p>“So I had this fight with Kirk Douglas, a sword fight, and he cuts my head off,” he said. “And when he cuts my head off, this [fake] blood and stuff squirts out like the veins in my neck. And, my God, they had to cut it, it was so gruesome. It squirted all over Douglas, all over the other actors around and everything, and today it would have been great. … But in those days, they said, ‘Oh, my gosh. We can’t let that be in the film’.”</p><p>Survivors include his wife of 18 years, Susan; children Cathy, Sean, Mandy, <span data-scayt_word=Maranda data-scaytid=26>Maranda</span> and Landon; grandchildren Danny, Tyler, Zachary, <span data-scayt_word=Juliah data-scaytid=27>Juliah</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Nataley data-scaytid=30>Nataley</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Caden data-scaytid=31>Caden</span>, Chance and Evelyn; and great-grandchildren Kelly, Angie and Mike.</p><p>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@mikebarnes4</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKu7x6elsmWUqrukrc1mm56ZlGK%2FsK7Ip2SbmaSirq95l29sbGlnZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
