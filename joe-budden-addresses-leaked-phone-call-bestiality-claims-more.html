You guys said that I fucked my dog and it was heavy on me yesterday," he said. Later, he exposes Raqi Thunda for allegedly leaking the phone call between him and Cyn Santana, claiming that she used to work closely with Cyn but, when she noticed Raqi's "toxic" traits, she cut ties with her.</p><p>Phillip Faraone/Getty Images&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So Raqi with her slimy, nasty fucking ass slithered her way into a very vulnerable, impressionable, hurt, and emotional Cynthia [Santana] and she was managing her. She started her management company," says Joe about their falling out. "She was directing videos, she was up on Dyckman. I didn't say a word. During this time, there were threats to take me to court for child support."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you make of this?</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Managing Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Alex Zidel began working at HotNewHipHop as a Staff Writer in February 2018 before becoming the Managing Editor in June 2019. &lt;strong>Favorite Hip Hop Artists:&lt;/strong> Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Young Thug, Frank Ocean.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiboVxfZJmoaidXZfCpbDEp2SanJSnsrS%2FxKxkpZ2RoLKlec%2BhpqedXZiurbiMm5ysrJmWuarA2GaapZmZosBurc2dZKanopp6r7HWrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
