His&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">mugshot</a> was released to the public yesterday and in it, he looked absolutely defeated.

The 81-year-old was sentenced to spend&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">3 to 10 years in a state prison</a> for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand. When he arrived at his new home for the next few years, more mugshot photos were taken in his prison uniform.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Inmate number&nbsp;NN7687, otherwise known as Bill Cosby, was moved to a prison in Pennsylvania after his sentencing and new images were taken for their records. Considering the situation, we wouldn't expect Cosby to look any happier than he did in the previous shots but he&nbsp;seems just as emotionally drained in the new one than in the last. Again, he is not looking at the camera as he appears to be on the verge of tears.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The maximum security facility, which apparently houses some of the most violent prisoners in the country, will be the disgraced comedian's home for at least&nbsp;3 years where he will be situated in a single cell next to the infirmary. If Cosby serves his entire 10-year sentence, he will be 91 at the time of his release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdha4B2gpFmmaKknGKwsL%2FBsqpmppWseq7BxqyfqKxdnsButtSsq2aZo2LAorCMmqpmrJiaeq2t0q1kqKaVYrumw9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
