Before deciding which one it is, it is necessary to note that not all books are canon. In 2012, Lucasfilm was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acquired by Disney</a>, and the latter decided to classify all the <i>Star Wars </i>book series that had already been released as Legends. As a result, all those books are not considered canon. This means that the list of the best <i>Star Wars </i>books canon is limited to those published after 2012.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eb324109692e6b09.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 best manga of all time that you should read in 2020</span></p></a><h2>Best <i>Star Wars </i>books that are canon</h2><p class=align-left>So far, many <i>Star Wars</i> canon books have been released, and book lovers have given positive feedback about most of them. Are<i> Star Wars </i>books any good? Yes, they are, because they contain intriguing and mind-blowing story-lines.</p><p class=align-left>How many<i> Star Wars </i>canon books are there? There are over 20 canon <i>Star Wars </i>comics, all of which are notable reads with different story-lines. Different people have authored them, so each has its unique perspective and insights. However, these are the top 10<i> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Star Wars</a></i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> canon novels</a>that are a must-read for all book lovers and lovers of<i> Star Wars</i> films.</p><h3>10. <i>Queen's Shadow</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eb324109692e6b09.png><p class=align-left><i>Queen's Shadow</i> is among the best canon <i>Star Wars</i> books, and E.K. Johnston authored it. Padmé Amidala is the central character and her walk through power in government is documented in an in-depth manner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/178c55e21921679e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top cyberpunk movies on Netflix for you and your loved ones</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike in the movies, the author explores what Padmé went through in detail. Her life after her reign as the queen of Naboo is explored. It also explored her interactions with her decoy called Sabe.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Exploring Padmé's handmaidens</a> keeps the plot going since each of them has a different character. Reading the story sheds more light on the politics that happen in the prequels.</p><p class=align-left>The plot generally explores her life before the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> right after she has completed her term as Queen Amidala of Naboo. She then assumes her role as the Galactic Senate representative.</p><p class=align-left>Compared to other books that explore her life, this is the most detailed. Before the release of this book, readers relied on <i>The Phantom Menace</i> fictional journals or the <i>Queen's Amulet </i>and <i>Queen in Disguise</i> story-lines to get more information about Padmé, but the information was still limited.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99266fdd7ea49327.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Check out the best military movies on Netflix right now</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Overall, the book helps the reader to connect the movies instead of viewing each as a standalone tale. Johnston's meticulous world-building is excellent, and it brings out each character very well.</p><h3>9. <i>Star Wars: Aftermath</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ef6d044d45d1195.jpg><p class=align-left>Chuck Wendig published one of the best <i>Star Wars</i> novels in 2015. The author explores the events <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">that occur after</a> the <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The Rebel Alliance is determined to destroy any surviving Empire loyalists.</p><p class=align-left>The novel also records the background details that caused the <i>First Order </i>and how the galaxy got to the state it was in at the beginning of <i>The Force Awakens</i>. The story is set about three decades before <i>The Force Awakens </i>and offers insight into how the galaxy will look like in the future.</p><p class=align-left>Rebel pilot Wedge Antilles is captured by Admiral Rae Sloane, forcing four other rebels to break into the palace to rescue him. The plot focuses on the new characters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/870445658d765747.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the best adventure movies on Netflix you need to know about</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After Rebel pilot Norra Wexley escapes death, she comes back to her mechanically-oriented teenage son to rebuild her life. Interrogator Sinjir Rath Velus is also back from the war, and he wants to drown his misery by drinking.</p><p class=align-left>Rae Sloane is a character who thinks fast, especially when she sees Imperial bureaucrats scrabbling over the infrastructural remains of the Empire. When four rebels are caught up in Akiva's Imperial operations, she keeps away the leaders who are fighting.</p><p class=align-left>As the plot develops, the four heroes work well together. They embrace their differences and help each other to grow.</p><h3>8. <i>Thrawn</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/178c55e21921679e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Timothy Zahn's <i>Thrawn</i> collection <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is in three parts</a>. The second is <i>Thrawn: Alliances </i>while the third is <i>Thrawn: Treason</i>. <i>Alliances</i> and <i>Treason</i> are some of the new <i>Star Wars </i>books (published 2018 and 2019, respectively,) but the first, which was published in 2017, is the current focus.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/968b880a95f5eca0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 must watch Hollywood movies for everyone</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The book </a>is one of the most iconic in the canon category, but it does not tell much about Thrawn and his origins. Instead, it focuses on the occurrences that led to his rise to power.</p><p class=align-left>The reader gains profound insight into the Empire and how he got so much power within a short period. It is interesting to see why and how he could have become the dictator who is mentioned in the original <i>Star Wars </i>books trilogy (<i>Thrawn</i> trilogy) from the 1990s.</p><h3>7. <i>Last Shot</i></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99266fdd7ea49327.jpg><p class=align-left>Daniel José Older authored<i> Last Shot</i>.

It explores the life of the Solo family before the <i>Sequel Trilogy </i>and right after the<i> Original</i>.</p><p class=align-left>The author allows us to know more <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">about Leia's life</a> as well as her relationship with Darth Vader.
