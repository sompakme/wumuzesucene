Instead, the country music icon named her widower, Larry Strickland, the executor of her estate,&nbsp;according to court documents obtained by <a href=#>Page Six</a>. Naomi asked that Larry have "full authority and discretion" over her property and requested that he receive "reasonable compensation" for services provided. "It is common to name the spouse as the executor of a will. But leaving out her daughters seems pointed, like a purposeful act on Naomi's part," an attorney <a href=#>told the outlet</a>&nbsp;in a separate report. Interestingly, should Larry be unable to perform his duties as executor, Naomi asked that&nbsp;Daniel Kris Wiatr, president of Wiatr & Associates, alongside her brother-in-law, Reginald Strickland, serve as co-executors — and not one of her daughters.</p><p>Wynonna, on the other hand, is "upset" that she won't inherit a piece of <a href=#>her mother's $25 million fortune</a>.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>Radar</a>, she&nbsp;has spoken to attorneys about possibly contesting the will. "Wynonna was banking on getting a piece of the pie," a source told the mag, adding that Wynonna has frittered away the fortune she earned as part of The Judds.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBjZ4Rxe82apqahXZ%2FCpbDSZpiurJ%2BlwLp50Z6nqKqkYsGmuMusZK2qkZy2pHnSraarsV2ks260xKtknZ2RqbVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
