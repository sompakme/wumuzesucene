"So the boys said, 'we will help you.' I am really proud of them."</p><p id=ekZPZakCOB1 data-wc=51>Elton, meanwhile, opened up about how he's eager for his sons to learn the value of money on their own without taking their huge fortune for granted.

They are spoilt in the way they live and how they're living, but they're not spoilt when it comes to the rules they have to live by. They get £3 pocket money, but £1 is for charity, £1 is for saving and £1 is for spending, they get three coins and put them in separate jars.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eFOLrRV9rnc data-wc=30>"And they have to work for it – help in the kitchen, help in the garden.

"That was the greatest decision I've made — well — we've made, in the last six years, is to have those boys," the proud dad explained to the Today show. "They're our primary concern. They're the things that come first and foremost."</p><p id=eIy8JI1B15gq data-wc=61>He added: "[Zachary] is very proud of his daddy, but he's more interested in 'Hotline Bling' by Drake or 'Uptown Funk,'. They sing 'Rocket Man.' They sing 'Benny and the Jets.' ... They know who I am. They know what I do, but they're more interested, to be honest with you, in their toys. And I'm fine with that. That's good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZRyam1nlaHBsLqMo6ahpl2Wu6V5w5qtopxdm8Kzusisn6xlo6S7tHnZmpqhmaKueqK6w2acpaGalrW0edKuqaunl5awunnSraaroZWoerOx1Z6YpZ2UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
