His support for ex-President Donald Trump was staunch during his tenure and remains to this day. And his outspoken critiques of the Obama and Biden governments have gained him fans and a dedicated following.</p><p>He is also wealthy and is a self-made man. If you want to know <strong>Sean Hannity net worth</strong>, you’re going to be surprised and maybe even flabbergasted by the numbers that I’m going to reveal to you. His wealth and assets are massive and reflect his influence in the current state of American political thought.</p><h2><span id=Sean_Hannity_Net_Worth_and_Salary>Sean Hannity Net Worth and Salary</span></h2><p>Starting out from relatively humble beginnings,&nbsp;<strong>Sean Hannity has built himself up a very impressive and extensive fortune</strong>. He has worked for decades in the public eye and has continued to build up support for his fiery brand of conservative thought. Most of his money has come from his work in radio and TV broadcasting, where he is able to command a very sizeable fee for his recurring appearances in both.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sean-hannity-net-worth-and-salary.png alt="sean hannity net worth and salary" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Currently, Sean Hannity’s net worth is estimated at $300 million!</strong></p><p>No, that’s not a typo. I didn’t add in an extra zero by mistake! If we take into consideration his combined assets and his annual income and subtract any debts, we come to this incredible 9-figure number. And here’s how he got there.</p><p>Hannity began work as a volunteer radio show host while still in college. Despite some inflammatory remarks that had him pulled from the air, he impressed a lot of people and was able to bill himself as the most sought-after host on college radio. From there, he moved into commercial radio, hopping from station to station as better and better offers and bigger audiences came along.</p><p>He currently hosts a 3-hour talk show five days a week,&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>The Sean Hannity Show</a>, which has a national and even international listenership. He makes about $15 million a year from this talk show.</p><p>But he’s even more recognizable to many for his television work. He has been the host and namesake of the show&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Hannity</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Fox News</a>&nbsp;since 2009. This show gives him a national platform for his ideas and conservative political commentary and has made him a household name in America.</p><p><strong>Being pals with a president surely doesn’t hurt, either…</strong></p><p>During the lead-up and full length of Donald Trump’s presidency, Hannity acted very much as an advisor and friend to the president. In many people’s view, he was a public mouthpiece for Trump, helping to outline and explain his policies and shift public opinion.</p><p>At Fox News, Hannity makes a salary of $25 million per year. This makes him&nbsp;<strong>Fox’s highest-paid screen star</strong>&nbsp;now that Tucker Carlson no longer works for the company. So together, his radio and TV salaries bring him in an impressive $40 million per year.</p><p>On top of that, Hannity is also something of a super-landlord. He owns approximately 900 properties across seven states, and many of these are rented out to produce income for him. He gains an estimated $3-5 million per year from this and other investment income. On top of this, Hannity has written and published four books to date. These titles have sold well and also contribute to his personal fortune.</p><p><strong>All told, his annual income fluctuates between $43 and $45 million per year before taxes.</strong></p><p>This makes Hannity one of the&nbsp;<strong>most wealthy and influential broadcasters in the USA</strong>&nbsp;and in history. It also gives him some political clout as he is able to use his money to donate to political campaigns he deems serve his agenda. It also allows him a great deal of influence to spread his political ideas and influence.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Born on the 30th of December, 1961, Sean Patrick Hannity is currently 61 years old. He was born in New York, NY, and spent his childhood growing up in Long Island, where he still owns a home to this day. All four of Hannity’s grandparents came to the USA from Ireland in the early 1900s, giving him a purely Irish American ancestry.</p><p>Sean Hannity’s parents were both involved in the justice system, and this influence played a major role in the formation of his political ideas. His mother was a stenographer and a corrections officer, while his father worked as a court officer.</p><p>Through his parents, Hannity gained an appreciation of the crime and punishment system in America. His parents, like so many Irish Americans, were staunch supporters of JFK, one of the most famous Democrat presidents in history. However, after his assignation, the family began to lean more to the right and support the Republican Party.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Early-Life-and-Education-4.png alt="Early Life and Education" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Time to learn…</strong></p><p>Hannity grew up and attended school in the predominantly white area of Franklin Square on Long Island, New York. This neighborhood was largely made up of the families of Italian, Irish, and German immigrants. He was raised Catholic and actually attended Sacred Heart Seminary and then St. Pius X Preparatory Seminary, both in Nassau County on Long Island.</p><p>When he graduated from high school, Hannity then attended college. First, he went to New York University and then Adelphi University. However, he wasn’t convinced of the value of a college education and ultimately left his studies to join the workforce. He didn’t earn a degree, and it wasn’t until 2005 that he was granted an honorary degree from Jerry Falwell’s Liberty University in Virginia.</p><p>For a change of scenery, Hannity moved out to California in the mid-80s. He began renting a house in Santa Barbara and set up a painting business that would eventually morph into general contracting. This is also the time when he began his career as a broadcaster.</p><h2><span id=Sean_Hannitys_Career>Sean Hannity’s Career</span></h2><p>While in Santa Barbara, Sean Hannity began to learn the ins and outs of radio hosting and commentary. He got his start as a community volunteer at the KCSB radio station at the University of Santa Barbara (though he never attended the institution). The radio station was run by a board of students, and they wanted to bring in a so-called “shock jockey” to bring the station’s sound more in line with commercial radio.</p><p>Hannity was selected as host of a call-in show called The Pursuit of Happiness. He was&nbsp;<strong>loud, aggressive, and controversial</strong>. At first, this is what the station wanted, but after making remarks&nbsp;<strong>considered racist, sexist, and homophobic</strong>&nbsp;by the board, he was relieved of his position.</p><p>He protested his firing and then lodged a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union. An ACLU lawyer helped him win his case on the grounds that his First Amendment rights were not respected. KCSB was forced to offer him his show back, but without offering him an apology or giving him a better time slot, Hannity refused and instead went looking for greener pastures.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sean-Hannitys-Career.png alt="Sean Hannity’s Career" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Radio_Show_Host>Radio Show Host</span></h3><p>He shopped himself around, billing himself as the&nbsp;<strong>most sought-after college radio host</strong>&nbsp;on the market. And he soon found a new home, now paid, with the conservative talk radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama. In 1992, he moved on to WGST in Atlanta. And then, in 1996, he made the move back home to New York, initially filling in for a drive-home host on WABC. In 1997 he was given his own late-night show. Then in 1998, he was moved into primetime.</p><p>As a paid host, Sean Hannity began making some serious money. In 2004 he was given&nbsp;<strong>a 5-year contract worth $25 million</strong>. When that contract expired, he renewed it in 2008, his value had gone way up. He was signed on for another five years, this time for a whopping $100 million. Clearly, there were people who wanted to hear what he had to say.</p><p>Hannity moved to New York’s WOR to host a daily 3-6 pm syndicated show that is distributed nationally. Currently,&nbsp;The Sean Hannity Show&nbsp;is a mix of political punditry, opinions, current affairs reviews, and interviews with guests, mostly from the political right. Hannity is also known for pushing extreme theories relating to controversial subjects and conspiracies. His style is hard and aggressive, loud, and in-your-face, and it seems that a great portion of the American public are fans.</p><h3><span id=TV_Show_Host>TV Show Host</span></h3><p>While his radio star was rising, TV also beckoned to the broadcaster. In 1996, he was approached by Fox News to join their team. He was paired with liberal commentator Alan Colmes to create a Crottfire-like show,&nbsp;Hannity & Colmes. This show aired from 2006-2009 and saw Hannity offer a conservative point of view and debate his liberal counterpoint, Holmes, while also making general commentary and interviewing guests.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TV-show-Host.png alt="TV Show Host" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition to this weekday show, Hannity was also given a weekend show of his own called&nbsp;Hannity’s America. In this program, he gave an overview of the news of the nation, followed by a 2-on-2 debate section with himself and another conservative debating issues with two liberal guests. It also featured a segment called “Beyond Belief,” which delved into supernatural ideas like ghosts and angels.</p><p>In 2009, Fox announced that Holmes was leaving the joint show, and it was rebranded as&nbsp;Hannity. This show features a format very similar to that of&nbsp;Hannity’s America. This show is live at 9 pm on weeknights and has become the&nbsp;<strong>most popular cable news show in this slot</strong>. He has an estimated viewership of close to two million, meaning his influence is far-reaching.</p><h3><span id=Real_Estate>Real Estate</span></h3><p>Leaving behind his fame and fortune from being a broadcaster, Sean Hannity is also a real property tycoon. As he gained notoriety and millions of dollars of income through his radio and TV jobs, Hannity began investing this money into real estate.</p><p>He started a real estate company that has bought up around 900 properties, most of which are rentals. Hannity now owns houses and apartments that are valued together at about 90 million dollars. These properties provide him with a substantial income that supplements his already huge salary.</p><h3><span id=Books>Books</span></h3><p>Not content for his voice to simply be heard on the radio and television, Hannity began authoring books in 2002.</p><p>To date, he has written and published four titles,&nbsp;Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty Over Liberalism&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism&nbsp;(2004),&nbsp;Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama’s Radical Agenda&nbsp;(2010), and his latest&nbsp;Live Free or Die: America (And the World) On the Brink.</p><h2><span id=Controversies>Controversies</span></h2><p>As an outspoken critic of government and politics, Sean Hannity has been a controversial figure for his whole career. In his early years, he was critical of LGBT people and issues, though he has since distanced himself from this rhetoric.</p><p>Most of the controversies surrounding him have been related to his political stances and assertions. Often labeled “conspiracy theories,” Hannity is known for hyping controversial ideas and sowing seeds of doubt in official narratives, much to the delight of his viewership.</p><h2><span id=Family_and_Personal_Life>Family and Personal Life</span></h2><p>Sean Hannity was raised Catholic in an Irish Catholic family. However, he left the church in 2019, citing corruption. However, he still carries the church’s teachings close to his heart and is a highly religious man.</p><p>In 1991, while Hannity was working as a host for WVNN in Alabama, he met journalist Jill Rhodes who worked for the&nbsp;Hunstville Times. The two began dating and were married in 1993. While they initially focused on building their careers, the couple started to think about having a family after their move to New York. In 1998, their son Patrick was born, and that was followed by their daughter, Merri, in 2001.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Family-and-Personal-Life.png alt="Family and Personal Life" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>With money pouring in as a result of Hannity’s hosting duties and growing real estate empire, Hannity’s children grew up in the lap of luxury. Focusing on athleticism, both children have made their marks in the tennis world, with Patrick playing for his college, Wake Forest University. Merri was ranked #4 in New York State in high school and now plays for the University of Michigan.</p><p>Hannity and his wife separated in the late 2010s and announced their divorce in 2020.</p><h3><span id=Interested_in_the_Net_Worth_of_Other_Major_Celebrities>Interested in the Net Worth of Other Major Celebrities?</span></h3><p>Then, don’t miss our comprehensive guides to the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Vanna White Net Worth</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Janice Pennington Net Worth</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Wink Martindale Net Worth</a>, the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Gene Rayburn Net Worth</a>, and many more!</p><p>And for more insider info on&nbsp;<strong>the world’s top TV hosts and Radio Personalities and their luxurious abodes</strong>, find out the&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Celebrities That Live in Nashville</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Who Lives on Star Island Miami</a>&nbsp;at the moment!
