Here is how she commented on it in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an interview with BEATROUTE</a>:</p>I used to write songs when I was growing up—I never really played instruments as a kid since I had terrible ADD that never allowed me to focus on one thing long enough to grasp it, so it was quite difficult trying to write on my own. I think that’s one of the big reasons I thought I could never be a singer. I always pictured these super cool, talented girls who had these guitars in their hands, and that just wasn’t me.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15cbbbe70d3fce53.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Antonia Gentry’s bio: age, height, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In July 2019, she released her first single – <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">I’m not Jealous</a></i>. She believed in herself thanks to the Netflix series <i>Family Reunion</i>:</p>The turning point for me was when my show, Netflix’s Family Reunion, wrote an episode where my character sings, and we ended up shooting a music video for it. It gave me the courage to go forward with my songs. Last summer was the first time I actually wrote anything that got released. It was a big step for me; I was terrified.<p class=align-left>Thanks to her mother's support, she managed to overcome her fears:</p>Thankfully my mother had always seen my love for music—even when it was hidden behind anxiety—so she pushed me to put that first song [“I’m Not Jealous”] out. I hated the song. I loved it when I first heard it and released it, but I’m the type of artist who gets sick of hearing my own voice. It’s not a bad song; it just isn’t the type of music I love [to] make.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/df342b74892735e6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lauren Pope’s biography: who is the TOWIE star dating now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here are Talia’s most popular tracks:</p><ul><li><i>Interlude</i></li><li><i>Piece of Me</i></li><li><i>You</i></li><li><i>Complicated</i></li><li><i>5FIVE</i></li><li><i>19</i></li><li><i>Hidden</i></li></ul><p class=align-left>In 2020, she portrayed Jade McKellan in the series <i>Game On!
