 Answer
Anticleia is the name of Odysseus’ mother who died in the Odyssey. She dies as a result of a shattered heart. Tiresias himself comes up to the scene and swallows the blood of Odysseus’s offering. He informs Odysseus that his ship will be wrecked and that all of his crew members would perish on the way home.
