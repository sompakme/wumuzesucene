There are a lot of warm words, pleasant epithets and comparisons.</p><ul><li>I miss you, and your smile is always on my mind. I miss your warm hugs and tender words so much, and my heart beats faster. There are no such words and emotions in the world to describe how much I miss you. Distance does not conquer my love. Hugs and kisses.</li><li>It seems like just a bit of time has passed without you, but I was already tired of counting the minutes spent apart. All my thoughts are connected exclusively to you. I want to touch, hug and kiss you immediately. You know, it seems to me, the Universe has frozen and time has stopped. How else can I explain my long-term waiting? I miss you.

I miss your tender words and warm smile, kind eyes and faithful support, strong hugs and sincere conversations. I look forward to our meeting, which, I hope, will come very soon.</li><li>I miss you like crazy. My heart is crying, and my soul is silent.

My heart is beating lonely and calling for you. When you are far away, the sky is not so starry, and the sun is not so bright, the wind is cold, and the heat burns. I miss you.</li><li>Talking with friends, favourite work, and pleasant memories cannot distract me from thinking about you and fill the inner emptiness. After all, a piece of the heart cannot be replaced. I miss you very much.</li><li>Where are you, my mysterious happiness? Where are you, my everlasting love? I feel terrible without your light. Everything is different without you. The sun is not the sun, but a light bulb, the wind is not the wind, but a fan. There is only deep, unstoppable longing without you near me.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7c482d51e5710475.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>True love quotes that will inspire romance in your relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top 50 I love you messages and wishes</p><ul><li>For me, separation from you is the most painful and horrible time. After all, when you are not with me, I immediately feel uneasy. There is a feeling of fear without you. You cannot even imagine how I miss you. I want time to pass unnoticed when we are apart, and pass very slowly when we are together!</li><li>You know, when I heard the expression "I miss you 60 seconds a minute," before we have met, I wondered how can we always think of only one person, how can we love someone more than life! After meeting you, everything changed. Now I understand that one second may seem the longest time without you. A day is not a day without you!</li><li>I always miss you, my love, and I cannot imagine how can I live without you, and wake up without you! I want to see your smile. I want the time not to be so cruel to us, and gave us more opportunities to be together! I think you are my soul mate.</li><li>I do not know in which latitudes our next meeting will occur, but I know that I will be the happiest person at that moment.</li><li>Our souls are like charges that collide during a thunderstorm.

Thank God, I have your photo, which helps me at least somehow to withstand this parting.</li><li>I miss you to hoarse, colic, sleepless nights, loss of appetite. You are the air that I breathe. You are the sky above my head. You are the rays of the sun, warming and hugging me every day. You are everything that surrounds me, that I see, hear, perceive. I hope now understand how much I need you to be with me.</li><li>Since you left, every second seems to be an eternity. I see how a second is born, matures and dies, then another appears, completely different from the previous one, then the third, and so on to infinity. I know the name of each of the seconds and the story of their lives. I see how slowly and monotonous time passes. It seeps through the fingers, goes into the ground, sprouts grass and trees. I know how time tastes. I feel its warmth and at the same time repellent and stinging cold.

Days before our meeting and days before our life together. Until the moment when I can breathe calmly and freely with the understanding that you are here. It costs a lifetime and an eternity of waiting. There is an eternity in every second without you. It descended upon me with all its weight at the moment when the door closed behind you. It settled in our house and sleeps on your pillow. It sounds inside me as your voice.</li><li>I taste your name as a rare and valuable oriental sweetness. I inhale and exhale, dissolve in it without residue all the time. I love your name. It is best for me. Come back, because I miss you.</li><li>I miss your voice, and every time you talk to me, I absorb it even by my skin. Do you hear it? Your voice pulses in the veins and fills with warmth every cell of my consciousness. Your voice is like a drug, sweet, magical, intoxicating drug. It is already impossible to get rid of or recover from it.</li><li>I have never missed anyone so much. I have never even felt with my fingertips the need of someone's presence, warmth, and breathing. Save me from the pain being without you.</li><li>I miss you. I see you now, between these words and lines. I love your smiling eyes. Oh no, this is not the notorious hazel!

I miss our leisurely, blissful, quiet and touching velvety of time; for the loud silence that is born in moments of secret and confidential conversation of our souls.</li><li>I miss you. I love your strength, character, your extraordinary and magical, soft, enveloping care without unnecessary words. I feel it not only with my heart but also with my whole being, every moment of my life. When you are far from me, I feel your thoughts turn to me, your emotions, fatigue and even more and brighter, I feel that you are also waiting for our meeting.</li><li>My bright sun! You left me and took away the light and desire for existence. Everything is not lovely, and nothing makes sense without you. I simply exist, without any joy and enthusiasm! Come back to me and give me your love and smile! I want to see your eyes and your beautiful face as soon as possible!</li><li>Tonight I had a dream, and of course, it was about you, my dear!
