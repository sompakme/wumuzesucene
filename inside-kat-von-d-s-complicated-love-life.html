At least, that's what she says. Following her broken engagement with Jesse James, the makeup mogul fell into the arms of Joel Zimmerman (aka Deadmau5). The pair dated on-and-off for about a year, with the DJ proposing on Twitter before the ring was even finished being made, according to the <a href=#>Daily News</a>. He apparently just couldn't wait.</p><p>Just like their engagement, we got to watch this couple's split play out on social media, too. Six months after Deadmau5 got down on a virtual knee, the pair was surrounded by breakup rumors. That's when Von D ominously <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Cheating on your loved one is the most hurtful thing one could do. I hate to have to admit, that this relationship is indeed over." So Deadmau5 cheated? Not so fast.</p><p>In a lengthy <a href=#>Facebook post</a>, the DJ admitted that the pair originally split in November 2012 before reconciling and getting engaged the following month. He was intimate with another woman while the couple were broken up, but Von D was apparently aware and they moved past it. "At the end of June, it was clear that the relationship was not working and we mutually ended the engagement," he wrote. "I was not, at any point, unfaithful to Kat during our time together." The third engagement is unequivocally not the charm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25nbH96e8inqqKclWK4osCMr6anZZSoeqS7zKmjopuRqbKlecuorZ5lnJ6zpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
