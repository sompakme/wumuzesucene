Since his departure from Formula One, Piquet has consistently been named among the sport’s finest drivers in numerous racing surveys. Piquet had a short professional tennis career before losing interest in the sport. He then turned to karting, concealing his name in order to avoid his father from finding his new pastime. The next year, he won the Brazilian national karting championship, followed by the Formula Vee title the following year. Piquet travelled to Europe on the recommendation of Emerson Fittipaldi, where he had even more success, setting a new record for the most victories in Formula Three in 1978, surpassing Jackie Stewart’s previous mark. His Formula One début came the following year with the Ensign team, after which he drove for McLaren and Brabham as well. The next year,&nbsp; Piquet joined the Brabham squad, where he placed second in 1980 before winning the title the following year. Piquet’s dismal performance in 1982 resulted in a revival in 1983, which resulted in his second world championship victory. Piquet had once again missed out on a chance to win the championship in 1984-85, although he did manage to pick up three victories during that time span. In 1986, he joined the Williams squad and was a championship contender until the last round of the Australian Grand Prix. When Piquet won his third and last world title in 1987, it was after a bitter struggle with teammate Nigel Mansell that left the two men’s friendship strained. Piquet then transferred to Lotus for the 1988-89 season, when he had his third consecutive season of poor performance. He finally joined the Benetton squad for the 1990-91 season, where he managed to win three races before deciding to hang up his hat. Following his retirement from Formula One, Piquet competed in the Indianapolis 500 for two years before giving up the sport. His Formula One career was interrupted by a brief foray into sports car racing, which he continued following his retirement. At the time of this writing, Piquet is retired and running various enterprises in Brazil, as well as overseeing his son Nelson Piquet Jr.<h2>Nelson Piquet Net Worth : $ 850,000</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Nelson Piquet Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Nelson Piquet’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Nelson Piquet Wiki</h2><span>﻿﻿﻿﻿</span><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Nelson Piquet Souto Maior</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$850,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 17, 1952</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 8″ (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Brazilian racing driver</td></tr><tr><td>Work Position</td><td>British Formula Three ChampionshipBARC Series Champion</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Brazilian</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Nelson Piquet, Piquet, Nelson</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Nelson Piquet FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Nelson Piquet get so rich?</li><li>What is Nelson Piquet Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Nelson Piquet Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Nelson Piquet make per day?</li><li>How much Nelson Piquet Net Worth ?</li><li>How Nelson Piquet become rich ?</li><li>How does Nelson Piquet make money ?</li><li>What is Nelson Piquet Income ?</li><li>How much Nelson Piquet Salary ?</li><li>How old is Nelson Piquet Age ?</li><li>How tall is Nelson Piquet Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfY6nnKWrn6N6sbXQrpytZZ6awW7DzquroWWZo7CwucRmqpqkkafGbrHAq6WippeoeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqpu9ZmpK6bmGK6sLrEsmSmmZuae6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
