Kristin Cavallari’s definition of beauty is “very different” than it used to be. “I’ve realized beauty is so much more than just your appearance,” she exclusively tells Marie Claire. “Look, it’s not like all of a sudden I’ve stopped caring—I would be lying if I said that were the case."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ever wonder how they get it all done in a day? Here's your answer.</p><p>Kristin Cavallari’s definition of beauty is “very different” than it used to be. “I’ve realized beauty is so much more than just your appearance,” she exclusively tells Marie Claire. “Look, it’s not like all of a sudden I’ve stopped caring—I would be lying if I said that were the case. But now I know that beauty really starts within and it’s about inner peace and harmony. When you have that, it radiates throughout your being.” That all being said, the Laguna Beach alum and mom of three’s routine has changed a little (well, a lot) over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, she still loves her makeup and skincare. In fact, she even launched her own brand Uncommon Beauty to make her personal product wishlist—including Bronzing Drops which *just* launched—a reality. But she’s placed a bigger daily focus on meditation (in her at-home infrared sauna), time with her kids, and staying off of social media (with the exception of before-bed scrolls). She’s added green juices *before* coffee and discovered the workout regimen that works for her body. That’s just the start of the "Back to the Beach With Kristin and Stephen" host's beauty routine. To get her entire breakdown, the scoop on her favorite products, and find out how she winds down at night, scroll ahead.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=rise-amp-shine-3>Rise & Shine</h2><p>It’s summer, so I’m not setting an alarm and it’s very nice. My kids are sleeping in and we’re having lazy mornings. However…on a normal morning I set an alarm for 6:30. I have to get up, brush my teeth, wash my face, and make breakfast for three kids. This is the one meal where I’ll actually make something different for all of them. It’s easy stuff like eggs and waffles. I also like to make myself a green juice because it helps me set the tone for the day. Typically I’ll do apple, lemon, cucumber, ginger, cilantro, and celery. It gives me energy, but I’m really such a coffee girl. I will forever drink coffee and I usually make a latte of some sort with homemade nut milk. Right now I'm on a Brazil nut milk kick. I have a legit espresso maker and froth the whole thing up. I take coffee very seriously.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=fitness-fix-3>Fitness Fix</h2><p>I work out with a trainer once a week, on Thursdays for an hour. He has me lifting really heavy weights. What I've learned over the years is that you just have to do what works for you—everybody’s body is different. I’ll also do one day of 30 minutes of cardio.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=morning-maintenance-xa0-3>Morning Maintenance&nbsp;</h2><p>After my workout, I will take a shower. I still don’t wash my face in the morning though; I’ll just use my toner P50 by Biologique Recherche. I use the Uncommon Beauty Pineapple Peptide Serum and Daily Water Cream. Then I have this big acne patch that I’ll cut up into little acne patches and use as a spot treatment if I’m getting any sort of blemish. I leave it there throughout the day and it takes it away pretty quickly. &nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Biologique Recherche Lotion P50 " data-url=https://www.joannaczech.com/products/lotion-p50 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100577549-14012902?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https://www.joannaczech.com/products/lotion-p50" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=joannaczech.com data-merchant-id=282852 data-merchant-url=joannaczech.com data-merchant-network=CJ><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BvRe27hSnNUYdoVQEM5jW-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Biologique Recherche Lotion P50</p><a href=# data-model-name="Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Daily Water Cream " data-url="https://uncommonjames.com/products/enhanced-daily-water-cream?variant=40554154033175&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ub-performance-max&gclid=CjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi168yzEIeUNzfWPeuQutoSKAaiMVhdI1EwPCqejSUT34KYKgM0LXGZDWhoCKFMQAvD_BwE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Funcommonjames.com%2Fproducts%2Fenhanced-daily-water-cream%3Fvariant%3D40554154033175%26currency%3DUSD%26utm_medium%3Dproduct_sync%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3Dsag_organic%26utm_campaign%3Dsag_organic%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dub-performance-max%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi168yzEIeUNzfWPeuQutoSKAaiMVhdI1EwPCqejSUT34KYKgM0LXGZDWhoCKFMQAvD_BwE&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - uncommonjames.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDXtkiCyMeQH9Q8rvB3pHW-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Daily Water Cream</p><a href=# data-model-name="Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Pineapple Peptide Nectar " data-url="https://uncommonjames.com/products/enhanced-pineapple-peptide-nectar?variant=40554154819607&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ub-performance-max&gclid=CjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi1683k6ykKBFxJY-5F1cvsQZIBqAcuplBJMVvIKZrAYrnKrPnvM-dowQRoCSc8QAvD_BwE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Funcommonjames.com%2Fproducts%2Fenhanced-pineapple-peptide-nectar%3Fvariant%3D40554154819607%26currency%3DUSD%26utm_medium%3Dproduct_sync%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3Dsag_organic%26utm_campaign%3Dsag_organic%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dub-performance-max%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi1683k6ykKBFxJY-5F1cvsQZIBqAcuplBJMVvIKZrAYrnKrPnvM-dowQRoCSc8QAvD_BwE&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - uncommonjames.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzkLRQ3pPj4AXYV628AF9W-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Pineapple Peptide Nectar</p><h2 id=power-start-xa0-3>Power Start&nbsp;</h2><p>Once I drop off the kids at school or camp, I'll probably eat eggs. I have a chicken coop, so I always have eggs, which is awesome. We have eight chickens and they each lay one egg a day. If we don't eat eggs one day, they start to really pile up. I'm always giving them away to friends who come over or just literally to whoever. The kids will take them into school and give them to their teachers.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

But I feel like I have split personalities because that's me in my day-to-day life, but then I love getting dolled up and going to an event or even just going to a dinner. I actually just discovered Jones Road and I am obsessed with their mascara. It’s a clean brand too, which I love. For brows I’ve always used the Anastasia Brow Wizz pencil—it’s been in my routine for years.&nbsp;I also love adding in the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://uncommonjames.com/collections/uncommon-beauty/products/bronzing-drops referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Funcommonjames.com%2Fcollections%2Funcommon-beauty%2Fproducts%2Fbronzing-drops&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - uncommonjames.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>Uncommon Beauty Bronzing Drops </a>into my routine for a subtle glow.</p><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sHWh6cJ5TvaLzFxc5VdaW-1920-80.png></p><p>Jones Road The Mascara</p><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdjWonZc27Nw2rfaSrsrqV-1920-80.png></p><p>Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz</p><h2 id=self-care-ritual-xa0-3>Self-Care Ritual&nbsp;</h2><p>I have an infrared sauna in my home. It’s a luxury and I am truly thankful for it every time I use it. It’s the best when I just want to take a minute for myself. I really love to meditate when I do it in the sauna. It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone. The heat obviously helps with the relaxation and I find that when I meditate I can get to a deeper state.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=signature-scent-xa0-3>Signature Scent&nbsp;</h2><p>People always ask me what perfume I'm wearing, so I'm gonna give you my secret.

I live and die by that. I have this oil, it’s by Kevin Murphy and called Young Again, and I swear by it. When I’m not doing anything, I put it all over my hair. I actually had a lot of breakage and this oil has completely saved my hair. It’s back to how it used to be, but it was rough getting here. It took a full year. You can put in a lot or even just a little on your ends and to slick down flyaways. It hydrates your hair in the perfect way.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Kevin Murphy Young Again Treatment Oil " data-url=https://kevinmurphy.com.au/us/en/km/products-/by-benefit-/rejuvenate-/YOUNG-AGAIN.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkevinmurphy.com.au%2Fus%2Fen%2Fkm%2Fproducts-%2Fby-benefit-%2Frejuvenate-%2FYOUNG-AGAIN.html&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - kevinmurphy.com.au" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D56eBawQFcEnRaG4quYwYV-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Kevin Murphy Young Again Treatment Oil</p><h2 id=cheap-but-chic-xa0-3>Cheap-But-Chic&nbsp;</h2><p>I’ll always get the classic blue Neutrogena makeup wipes.

Anyone that is aging gracefully though is my icon. We live in a world now where that’s so not the norm, and I think you really have to be brave to just embrace it. It says you have a lot of self-confidence, and for me that is what beauty is.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=backup-career-xa0-3>Backup Career&nbsp;</h2><p>I’d be an interior decorator.

It was just really harsh and dried out my skin and once I was able to get off of it, my skin became so much better.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Daily Foaming Powder Cleanser " data-url="https://uncommonjames.com/products/enhanced-daily-foaming-cleanser?variant=40554154229783&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ub-performance-max&gclid=CjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi168zk_yxFP5ip_zpdmnbx5eKfYqhKdFr745iZfB2WK083g8bJRqt4UqBoCz1AQAvD_BwE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Funcommonjames.com%2Fproducts%2Fenhanced-daily-foaming-cleanser%3Fvariant%3D40554154229783%26currency%3DUSD%26utm_medium%3Dproduct_sync%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3Dsag_organic%26utm_campaign%3Dsag_organic%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dub-performance-max%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi168zk_yxFP5ip_zpdmnbx5eKfYqhKdFr745iZfB2WK083g8bJRqt4UqBoCz1AQAvD_BwE&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - uncommonjames.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhspSGy996kWBGBoYMRBTW-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Uncommon Beauty Enhanced Daily Foaming Powder Cleanser</p><a href=# data-model-name="Uncommon Beauty Retinol Alternative " data-url="https://uncommonjames.com/products/retinol-alternative?variant=40337851154455&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ub-performance-max&gclid=CjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi1685EEL6xyXwnHW10uqkxODtV5VMAxqpc_Ue_3pilKN1SY81rTM-wN5BoC1gEQAvD_BwE" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Funcommonjames.com%2Fproducts%2Fretinol-alternative%3Fvariant%3D40337851154455%26currency%3DUSD%26utm_medium%3Dproduct_sync%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_content%3Dsag_organic%26utm_campaign%3Dsag_organic%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dub-performance-max%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjws7WkBhBFEiwAIi1685EEL6xyXwnHW10uqkxODtV5VMAxqpc_Ue_3pilKN1SY81rTM-wN5BoC1gEQAvD_BwE&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkristin-cavallari-beauty-routine" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - uncommonjames.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUPTwgMhVZKZfWyvvTfzxV-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Uncommon Beauty Retinol Alternative</p><h2 id=lights-out-xa0-3>Lights Out&nbsp;</h2><p>My nights are crazy because my kids are a little bit older now, so they stay up until nine o’clock. I’m so tired once I get them to bed that I pretty much go to my bed right away. I would be lying if I didn’t admit that I scroll TikTok and Instagram for a few minutes. I just joined TikTok three weeks ago and I’m getting a lot of tarot card readers. I hate that that’s even part of my routine. I want to get to a place where I don’t do it and read instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, before I fall asleep I really try to think of all the things that I’m grateful for. I really believe in the law of attraction and that if you think and feel good things, then good things will come back to you. I try to focus on all the positives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6kqaKrpJ67bq%2FAr5ilpJGntm6uxJqsrbFdp7y2wMinnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
