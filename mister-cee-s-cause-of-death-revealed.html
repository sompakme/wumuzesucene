He reflected on their relationship during an interview with Rock the Bells, last November. "The first time I met him was when his DJ, 50 Grand, rest in peace, brought Big to my house. The plan was we were going to redo the basement demo that he and 50 Grand put together," Mister Cee recalled at the time. "Big was very shy. He would always talk with his head down and say, 'Yo man, don't be promising me nothing, man. If you say you're going to do something, do it.' And I'm like, nah, we're going to redo the demo. We weren't in a studio. We were at my house. I did it with two turntables, just cutting the record back and forth. We had a little cheesy mic that was better than the mic 50 Grand had at his house."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Upon news of Cee's death, many noteworthy names in hip-hop shared condolences on social media including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Premier</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a>, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Peter Rosenberg, Queen Latifah, and more.
