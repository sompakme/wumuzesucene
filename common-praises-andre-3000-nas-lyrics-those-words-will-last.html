After all, he says that he's still jaw-dropped by what the artist has been able to come up with over the years. "Him [André 3000] and Nas, for me, are the two that I’ll be like, ‘Damn, I wish I wrote that,’" he said. Elsewhere in the interview, he showed love to Nas for the lyricism in his 1994 Illmatic track <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"N.Y. State of Mind."</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I was playing ‘New York State of Mind’ and one of the greatest lines ever written is, ‘Beyond the walls of intelligence life is defined/ I think of crime when I’m in a New York state of mind,’” he described. "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">That's like poetry.</a> That's like American literature," Common continued. "When they put that next to James Baldwin and Nikki Giovanni, those words will last." What do you think of Common praising Nas and Andre 3000 for their writing skills? Do you agree with him?
