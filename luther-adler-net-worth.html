He was one of the six children of <a href=#>Russian</a> Jewish actors Sara and Jacob P. Adler. His father was considered to be one of the founders of the Yiddish theatre in America. His siblings also worked in theatre; his sister Stella Adler achieved fame as an <a href=#>Actress</a> and drama <a href=#>Teacher</a>. His brother Jay also achieved some fame as an actor.</p><span>1908</span><p>Adler's father gave him his first acting job in the Yiddish play, <i>Schmendrick,</i> at the <a href=#>Thalia</a> Theatre in Manhattan in 1908; Adler was then 5 years old. His first Broadway plays were <i>The Hand of the Potter</i> in 1921; <i>Humoresque</i> in 1923; <i>Monkey Talks</i> in 1925; <i>Money <a href=#>Business</a></i> and <i>We Americans</i> in 1926; <i>John</i> in 1927; <i>Red Rust</i> (or <i>Rust</i>) and <i>Street Scene</i> in 1929.</p><span>1931</span><p>In 1931 Adler became one of the original members of the Group Theatre (New York), a New York City theatre collective formed by <a href=#>Cheryl</a> Crawford, Harold Clurman, and Lee Strasberg. The founders, as well as the actors in the group, "tended to hold left-wing political views and wanted to produce plays that dealt with important social issues." The collective lasted for ten years, had twenty productions, and served as an inspiration for many actors, <a href=#>Directors</a>, and playwrights who came after it. During those years, the Group's members included Luther, Luther's sister and brother, Stella Adler and Jay Adler, Elia Kazan, <a href=#>John Garfield</a>, Paul Green (playwright), Howard Da Silva, Harry Morgan (billed as Harry Bratsburg), Franchot Tone, John <a href=#>Randolph</a>, Joseph Bromberg, Michael Gordon, Will Geer, Clifford Odets and Lee J. Cobb. Elia Kazan considered Adler to be the best actor working in the company.</p><span>1932</span><p>In 1932 Adler starred in John Howard Lawson's, <i>Success Story</i> and garnered rave reviews for his performance. In 1933 Adler briefly joined the Katherine Cornell Company, playing opposite Cornell in <i>Alien Corn</i>, but in 1934 he returned to the Group and played alongside his sister Stella in the <i>Gold Eagle Guy</i>. Unfortunately Gold Eagle Guy was not popular with audiences and had a short run. Adler had suspected the play would not succeed, remarking, shortly before it opened, "Boys, I think we're working on a stiff." Adler went on to appear in Group Theatre (New York) productions: <i>Awake and Sing!</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i> (both 1935), and he performed with Frances Farmer in <i>Golden Boy</i> (1937). He also appeared in Kurt Weill's anti-war musical <i>Johnny Johnson</i> (1936) and originated the role of Captain Joshua in the 1939 Group Theater production of Thunder Rock. "By the late 1930s... the cohesiveness of the group began to crumble. The chronic financial problems and long-simmering disputes about 'the method' began to chip away at their solidarity... and in 1941 the group dissolved."</p><span>1937</span><p>In 1937 Adler began to appear in films, although they were never his highest priority. His credits included <i>Wake of the Red Witch</i> (1948), <i>House of Strangers</i> (1949), <i>D.O.A.</i> (1950), <i>The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel</i> (1951) (appearing as Hitler), <i>M</i> (1951), <i>Voyage of the Damned</i> (1976) and <i>Absence of Malice</i> (1981).</p><span>1938</span><p>Adler was married to <a href=#>Actress</a> <a href=#>Sylvia</a> Sidney from 1938 until 1946 and was the father of Sidney's only child, her son Jacob, who predeceased her.</p><span>1940</span><p>By the early 1940s Adler began to direct, but his first production <i>They Should Have Stood in Bed</i> closed after only eleven performances in 1942. His next directorial venture, <i>A Flag is Born</i>, ran for 120 performances in 1946 and featured newcomer Marlon Brando in one of the major roles. In 1965, when Zero Mostel left the Broadway cast of <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> during a contract dispute, Adler took over the role of Tevye.</p><span>1960</span><p>He also acted frequently on television in such programs as the anthology series, <i>Crossroads</i>, <i>General Electric Theater</i>, <i>Kraft Television Theater</i> and <i>Robert Montgomery Presents</i>. He guest-starred in 1960 in the science fiction fantasy series, <i>The Twilight Zone</i> as the poor pawnbroker Arthur Castle, with Vivi Janiss as his wife Edna, in the episode entitled "The Man in the Bottle." in the story line, a genie offers the couple four wishes which do not lead to happiness. He was also cast in episodes of <i>The Untouchables</i>, <i>Ben Casey</i>, <i>77 Sunset Strip</i>, <i>Mission: Impossible</i>, <i>Hawaii Five-O</i>, most notably in the series' only three-part episode "'V' for Vashon", <i>The Streets of San Francisco</i>, <i>Naked City</i> and <i>Route 66</i>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1903 births</a> <a href=#>1984 deaths</a> <a href=#>American male film actors</a> <a href=#>American male stage actors</a> <a href=#>American male television actors</a> <a href=#>American people of Russian-Jewish descent</a> <a href=#>Jewish American male actors</a> <a href=#>Male actors from New York City</a> <a href=#>20th-century American male actors</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmecqsGpsdFmmJ2klad6r7HTZq6oqqSdeneDkXBu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
