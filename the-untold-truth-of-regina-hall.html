According to <a href=#>The Shadow League</a>, Hall had moved from her native Washington D.C. to New York to attend Fordham University but wasn't sure what to do after graduating. "My mom and dad were like, 'What are you going to do? You been in New York six months...'" she recalled. "So I was like, 'I'll go back to school.' Cause I always loved school, classes and learning."</p><p dir=ltr>Hall did just that, attending New York University to get her master's degree in journalism. She chose that particular line of study because it, as she shared with the outlet, "seemed like something powerful." She continued, "I thought most people believe what they read, so the power of someone holding a pen in our culture, especially, was tremendous." She also told&nbsp;<a href=#>Fader</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that she was heavily influenced by the book "Democracy in America," explaining, "It talked about the importance of journalism to democracy."</p><p dir=ltr>Her respect for the line of work has only grown. "Now, with everything going on politically," she said in Fader, "I value journalism even more and realize how difficult the job is." Yet, what she learned has impacted her work as an actor. "There's days where I'd be like, 'Ah, I'd want to tell that story; because it's so imperative," she explained. Hall has experience teaching too, having briefly done so at a New Rochelle college. She shared on "<a href=#>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a>," "I thought I was good. I was strict because I was young."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHFlaoJxe9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd50Z6eoqaRYrWiuMto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
