Charles never really fell out of love with Camilla, and they eventually resumed their affair, leading to both of their divorces in the 1990s and their eventual marriage in 2005.</p><p>There’s a thousand differences between the Charles and Diana marriage—which lasted from 1981 until their separation in 1992 and eventual divorce in 1996—and the Charles and Camilla marriage. A key one? Charles was “jealous of Diana’s success” but “couldn’t be more proud of Camilla,” according to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/king-charles-jealous-dianas-success-33269642 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Mirror</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lp9rSvDSyPJqt7nKbpzjkG-1920-80.jpg><p>The Charles and Diana marriage, for a whole host of reasons, was never meant to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla turned 77 this week, and spent her birthday Wednesday with her husband at the State Opening of Parliament. After Charles announced his cancer diagnosis on February 5, Camilla—now Queen Camilla—stepped up for her husband, the King, in a major way, often steering the ship of the monarchy as he began treatment for cancer, which continues today. “It’s safe to say that the last seven months have seen her grow into her role better than anyone could have ever hoped for,” The Mirror writes. “Once regarded as one of the most unpopular members of the royal family due to her relationship with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/king-charles/>King Charles</a> while he was still married to Princess Diana, since tying the knot with the monarch in 2005, her popularity has steadily risen year on year.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4swTt5dELegnvfyA4uTGS-1920-80.jpg><p>It’s true—if you had told anyone in, say, 1993 that Camilla Parker-Bowles would not only one day be called Queen Camilla but be absolutely beloved by the British public and the world, you would have been laughed all the way out of town. Tack on that Camilla was pretty much solely responsible for keeping the monarchy afloat earlier this year, and your 1993 friends would have thought you’d completely lost your mind. But it’s true, and Camilla has really proven herself in her royal role over the past 19 years, taking on tough topics and immersing herself in her work as a member of the royal family.</p><p>“I think she might have surprised herself by enjoying hard work as much as she seems to be doing,” said former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond with a laugh. “She is, after all, a woman who has never had to knuckle down to the slog of a 9-to-5 job. She has shouldered a sharply increased workload and a massive amount of responsibility in the past few months, and is looking and sounding great on it.”</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
