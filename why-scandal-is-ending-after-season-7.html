Channing Dungey, entertainment president at ABC, spoke with reporters about the decision during her pre-upfronts press call with reporters Tuesday and noted that Rhimes always envisioned seven seasons for the fast-paced Washington, D.C.-set soap.
“I had conversions with Shonda Rhimes where she has had for a while a sense of how she wanted the story to end,” Dungey told reporters Tuesday ahead of ABC’s upfront presentation to ad buyers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But actually going through with it? Actually standing up to say: ‘This is it?’ Not so much. So, next year we are going all out. Leaving nothing on the table. Creating this world in celebration. We are going to handle the end the way we like to handle the important things in our Scandal&nbsp;family: all together, white hats on, Gladiators running full speed over a cliff.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=22>Rhimes</span> always envisioned Scandal as a show that did not have a long lifespan — her Grey’s Anatomy is heading into its <span data-scayt_word=14th data-scaytid=25>14th</span> season in the fall — and always saw it as a seven-season show. Ahead of the fourth season opener, <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=24>Rhimes</span> <a href=#>told <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=28>THR</span></a>&nbsp;that the drama inspired by the life of fixer Judy Smith wasn’t a “10-season or eight-season show.”<p>In its sixth season, Scandal has had to reinvent itself following the surprising November election that sent Republican and former reality TV personality Donald Trump to the White House. Suddenly, <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=27>Rhimes</span>‘ show about the insane things that politicians do didn’t seem so insane. (Producers had to scrap a planned storyline about Russians hacking the show’s presidential election when reality hit too close to home, for example.) During an oral history interview with <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=30>THR</span> in April pegged to the landmark <span data-scayt_word=100th data-scaytid=33>100th</span> episode of Scandal, <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=32>Rhimes</span> was vocal about the show’s uncertain future in the country’s current political climate.</p><p>“Any of the stories we planned now just feel like we’re copying what’s happening in reality, which is insane,” she said. “I used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don’t know if that’s our destination anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, Scandal will leave an incredible legacy behind when it closes up shop for good during the 2017-18 broadcast season.&nbsp;The drama helped usher in a new era of diversity on the small screen when <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=35>Rhimes</span> cast Washington as fixer Olivia Pope. Washington picked up her first Emmy nomination in 2013 and became the first African-American to be nominated for best drama actress in the past 18 years and fifth overall.</p><p>The series also further solidified <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=37>Rhimes</span> as one of television’s most powerful <span data-scayt_word=showrunners data-scaytid=39>showrunners</span> and helped ABC bolster its Thursday lineup. With Scandal sandwiched between Grey’s Anatomy at 8 p.m. and the <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes-produced data-scaytid=40>Rhimes-produced</span> How to Get Away With Murder at 10 p.m., ABC created a “<span data-scayt_word=TGIT data-scaytid=41>TGIT</span>“-branded night consisting of three <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes-produced data-scaytid=42>Rhimes-produced</span> dramas.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Next up for <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=44>Rhimes</span> is the long-awaited launch of Romeo and Juliet drama Still Star-Crossed. And while sophomore drama The Catch was canceled after two seasons, <span data-scayt_word=Shondaland data-scaytid=49>Shondaland</span> — <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=48>Rhimes</span>‘ production company with longtime producing partner Betsy Beers — scored a series pickup for <a href=#>For the People</a>, which has been described as a legal version of Grey’s Anatomy. All told, <span data-scayt_word=Rhimes data-scaytid=51>Rhimes</span> will enter next season with four shows on the air again: Grey’s, Scandal, Murder and People, with a renewal for Still Star-Crossed having the potential to make it five for the second season in a row.</p><p>Scandal returns in the fall as part of ABC’s <span data-scayt_word=TGIT data-scaytid=53>TGIT</span> lineup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOsJ%2ByZaOYrq%2BwwKVkoqtdmrultc2gZKydkai8r3mWZmhpaGRmfnR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
