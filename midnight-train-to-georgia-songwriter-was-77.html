He played quarterback for Ole Miss and won the national championship with the team in 1962 and the SEC in 1963.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>After college, he focused on a music career, moving to Los Angeles and recorded with the likes of&nbsp;Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers, Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney amongst other stars, but his most fruitful and lasting partnership was with Gladys Knight and her group.</p><p>The Weatherly-penned hit “Midnight Train to Georgia” topped the charts in 1973, winning a Grammy Award in 1974. It was later&nbsp;inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 and was ranked amongst Rolling Stone‘s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.</p><p>The song has become Knight’s signature song and been&nbsp;covered by a number of artists including Aretha Franklin.</p><p>“I’m missing him already,” Knight told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. “I love him and always will. He was about life and love and he wrote it so simply, he grew my love for country music. When we were with him it was like we’d always been together, we fit together. He started playing his guitar, and I started humming and it was magic.”His music propelled us to a whole different level. I loved him and his music, he was a sweetheart and so gentle.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Bftq551p6YraCVp7m6ecyim6ehl53BbsDRmqCnZaSkeqixzqueopldqLyvs9aroK2domKxqrHSZpitZWdsenV9kXFqcHBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
