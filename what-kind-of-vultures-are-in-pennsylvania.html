</span><strong>turkey vulture (Cathartes aura)</strong><span> is a Pennsylvania mainstay.</span><span> These big guys,</span><span> with wingspans reaching up to six feet,</span><span> are the </span><strong>undisputed champs</strong><span> of vulture-dom in the state.</span><span> They have a keen sense of smell,</span><span> which is impressive considering their,</span><span> ahem,</span><span> less-than-refined dining habits.</span><span> They can sniff out a dead deer from a mile away,</span><span> which is a handy skill when your menu consists exclusively of things that are no longer,</span><span> well,</span><span> living.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:83><strong>Fun fact:</strong><span> Turkey vultures have a bald head for a reason!</span><span> Without feathers,</span><span> they avoid getting maggots and other creepy crawlies in their hair...</span><span>er,</span><span> I mean,</span><span> feathers...</span><span>while they feast.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:48>Black is Back: The Newest Member of the Club</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:295><span>The </span><strong>black vulture (Coragyps atratus)</strong><span> is a more recent addition to Pennsylvania's vulture scene.</span><span> These sleek,</span><span> black birds are smaller than turkey vultures,</span><span> but just as important to the ecosystem.</span><span> They're expanding their range northward,</span><span> and Pennsylvania is now a proud vulture melting pot!</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:192><strong>Heads up:</strong><span> Black vultures are a little less shy than turkey vultures,</span><span> and you might see them hanging out near roadsides or even airports (though hopefully they're not causing any delays!</span><span>).</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:40>So You Think You've Seen a Vulture?</h2><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:63><span>Telling these two apart can be tricky,</span><span> but here are some clues:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=21:1-23:68><li data-sourcepos=21:1-21:63><strong>Size:</strong><span> Turkey vultures are bigger with a broader wingspan.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:112><strong>Head:</strong><span> Turkey vultures have a red,</span><span> wrinkly head,</span><span> while black vultures have a black head (shocking,</span><span> I know).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=23:1-23:68><strong>Behavior:</strong><span> Turkey vultures tend to soar in circles,</span><span> while black vultures might flap their wings more often.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:161><strong>Remember:</strong><span> These vultures are protected by law,</span><span> so admire them from afar and don't try to befriend them (they might mistake your fingers for a tasty snack!</span><span>).</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=27:1-27:38>Frequently Asked Vulture Questions</h2><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:169><strong>How to identify a vulture vs. a hawk?</strong><span> Vultures have broader wings and soar effortlessly,</span><span> while hawks flap their wings more and have a more aggressive hunting style.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:130><strong>How to avoid attracting vultures to your yard?</strong><span> Vultures are scavengers,</span><span> so make sure to dispose of any dead animals properly.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=33:1-33:186><strong>How to help vultures?</strong><span> Leave them alone!</span><span> They're a vital part of the ecosystem and don't need our help (unless maybe you need a recommendation for a good carrion removal service...</span><span>).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=35:1-35:128><strong>How to impress your friends with vulture trivia?</strong><span> Did
