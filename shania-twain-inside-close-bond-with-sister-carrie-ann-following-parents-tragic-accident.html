The family had already been through tough times when Shania was young and growing up in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, with Shania previously revealing that she was "abused" at the hands of Jerry.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8AYQ6Pdix data-wc=9>The family also faced poverty and poor living conditions.</p><p id=eIE23C-7t4Y data-wc=36>The singer told The Sun previously: "It was a [expletive] way to grow up.<strong>&nbsp;I wouldn't want to do it again but I was more prepared as a person because of the hardship I came from."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7dfd426ba242-shania-twain-in-1996.jpg><p id=eIgTp8ja0a4 data-wc=38>Trauma occurred again after the accident and Shania was left without her parents.

As rickety as it was, it was still a foundation.</strong></p><p id=e8yQ87V9fWj data-wc=22>"My whole life history was there, with them, and many of the associations fell along the way, away, after my parents died.</p><p id=eQrOdn_fdz data-wc=24>"It was so true that so much of my life was stemming from them being in my life — the good and the bad."</p><h2>Shania Twain's bond with Carrie-Ann</h2><p id=eMYZO_UTIoe data-wc=20>Shania Twain's younger sister, Carrie-Ann, is the only sibling who has really been seen in public alongside the famous singer.</p><p id=ebI1IgGym4m data-wc=29>Carrie-Ann supported her older sister in 2011 when Shania was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the two were pictured in an embrace looking elated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0b6d902a4e46-shania-twain-and-sister.jpg><p id=eMcFOMDF0o5 data-wc=59>Fans might be surprised to know that Shania's younger sister also provided backup vocals for her Vegas residency in 2012. Shania explained afterwards that it was her younger sister who had encouraged her to put on the massive show: "She was encouraging me [saying] 'Oh, yeah, come on. You can do it. You can do it,'" Shania told CMT.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLiM1wc7iB data-wc=19>"And so I said, 'Well, listen, how about if you do it, I’ll do it? We'll do it together.'"</p><p id=efvsn8_zfwtT data-wc=35>She continued: "That was just really a turning point for me — knowing that she was into the idea of participating and not just being there behind the scenes but taking that plunge, as well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0404e6a0555c-gettyimages-1276514077.jpg><h2>What has Shania Twain said about her family?</h2><p id=e3-_jClY70fK data-wc=44>As well as speaking about her bond with Carrie-Ann, Shania has said she viewed all three of her younger siblings as her own children while she was raising them. "I call them [my kids] often. I know they're not mine, but I say that.</p><p id=eTJ6z3WD2eoi data-wc=56>"My younger sister was still living at home, and my two younger brothers were still 13 and 14 years old at the time. We all agreed that they shouldn't be separated. But no relatives were able to take both of them in. So, the only way to keep them together was for us to stay together."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
