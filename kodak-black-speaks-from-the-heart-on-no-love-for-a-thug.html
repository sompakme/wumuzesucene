The “Super Gremlin” artist slid through with the release of his new single, “No Love For A Thug” this morning. Kodak Black collides with Lbeats for his latest offering, which shows a more vulnerable side. Over mournful piano chords and slow-burning 808s, Yak shares a soul-bearing offering where he divulges his deepest thoughts.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kodak-black-s-introspection-comes-out-on-new-single>Kodak Black’s Introspection Comes Out On New Single</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With an introspective outlook on the world, the rapper’s new single finds him grappling with a harrowing reality. He mournfully details the loss of his friends and family within the song's opening bars before delving into the dichotomy between having one foot in the streets and the other in the rap game. Ultimately, it sounds like a cry for help at his loneliest; a search for genuine love in a world full of snakes and opportunists. In the second verse, Kodak reflects on heartbreak.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The release of “No Love For A Thug” comes just before he headlines the 2023 Black Spring Break in Biloxi. Yak is expected to touch the stage on Saturday at the Coliseum. The show also includes performances from Nardo Wick, EST Gee, Fynesse 2 Times, and Gloss Up. Hopefully, Yak will also perform his latest single during his upcoming performance.
