He was ready to star with Vince Vaughn in a film called, "The Gelfin." The last film he ever made, "Almost Heroes" with Matthew Perry, was posthumously released a few months after his death.&nbsp;</p><p>Farley had recently signed with a new agency called Endeavor, after gaining significant fame as well. They released a heart-breaking statement that said:&nbsp;"We are saddened at the sudden loss of Chris Farley, whose screen presence was as indisputable as his talent for making people laugh. This is a great loss for the industry and we offer our deepest sympathy to his family and his legions of fans around the world" (via <a href=#>Variety</a>). It was also rumored that Farley was set to star as the voice of "Shrek" as well.</p><p>Perry revealed in his memoir, "<a href=#>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a>"&nbsp;that he punched a hole in his "Friends" co-star Jennifer Anniston's dressing room after learning the news of Farley's death.&nbsp;"Then, Chris Farley died. His disease had progressed faster than mine had. (Plus, I had a healthy fear of the word 'heroin,' a fear we did not share)." It's no doubt that Farley would be, if not already, one of the world's greatest comedians and movie stars.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
