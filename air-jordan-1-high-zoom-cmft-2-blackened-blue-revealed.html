In fact, Jordan Brand has subsequently come out with the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Air Jordan 1 High Zoom CMFT 2</a>. Sure, it is quite the mouthful, however, fans are still copping it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Whenever Jumpman comes out with a new silhouette, you can be sure that a ton of colorways are going to follow suit. When it comes to this new offering, that is most definitely the case. Over the past few months, this shoe has been hit with a ton of great teasers. For the most part, fans are loving what they're seeing, and as a result, Jordan Brand will not slow down. With this latest color scheme, Jumpman has another hit on its hands.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-a-new-air-jordan-1-high-zoom-cmft>A New Air Jordan 1 High Zoom CMFT</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This color scheme is actually going to be called "Blackened Blue" and it is very easy to see why. Firstly, the shoe actually opens up with some sail coloring on the toe box and the side panels. Secondly, the overlays here are black, except for on the top cuff and the midfoot. The colors that are found in these particular places are just blue. Overall, it makes for a very nice look that fans can definitely appreciate and get behind.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At this point in time, the shoe does not have an official release date. However, it should be dropping very soon for a price of $150 USD. If you are a fan of these, definitely consider scooping them up.
