Mizanin explained to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that when he told his friends the potential name of his child, they said, "Dude that's a stripper name." Maryse was furious about the comment and kicked the guys out of the party. The wrestlers scrapped the name idea and Maryse proposed a French name. But she claimed that didn't work because Mizanin would instead pronounce it with a Spanish inflection. Mizanin and Maryse ultimately settled on a name and in 2018, the pair welcomed their first child together, daughter Monroe Sky Mizanin.</p><p dir=ltr>When his daughter was an infant, Mizanin explained that the parental roles mimicked the WWE fighting ring. "Literally, we're just tagging in and out," he said about sharing duties with Maryse. "I'm a night owl so I usually stay up at night with her and my wife sleeps. Then whenever I sleep, my wife takes over," Mizanin added. According to the wrestler, even with his busy schedule entertaining fans, he wanted to have his family come first. "I wanted to be the dad that was able to feed my daughter, hold my daughter, really be there for my daughter. I want to be the dad that's here."</p><p>Mizanin couldn't be prouder when he welcomed a second daughter, Madison Jade, in 2019. "There's no better feeling than being a father to two strong, independent, creative, beautiful women," he told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2pobYNxe9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zKKinmWknbJuucizZKahqpa7qrqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
