Interestingly, Ben Foden wife is not a popular celebrity.</p><h2>Ben Foden surprise wedding</h2><p class=align-left>It had only been<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 2 weeks of dating</a> when Ben Foden marriage was announced. The public came to learn of the news when he shared about his wedding on social media. How were the nuptials done and who exactly is Jackie?</p><h3>Explaining the rush</h3><p class=align-left>It seemed rather surprising that the wedding was rushed. Ben did not hold it when such concerns came up. He went on to express himself on his Instagram page by saying that the world is indeed a funny place as it works things out. He acknowledged that people thought he was a bad person and that he expected some not-so-good comments left under his post by those he referred to as 'keyboard warriors'.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/364ecc28a07c49ae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I was a security man before promotion came - Young man narrates how he became company manager</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Besides that though, he went on to say that he met a girl that had him smitten and that the love she offered captured his heart in a way no one had in a while. It is this in-depth devotion that pushed him to choose to marry Jackie after just 2 weeks of dating. He had no reason to wait yet someone great had come into his life.</p><p class=align-left>Jackie is the woman who came into his life when he needed her most. They seemed to complement each other and for this reason, he felt it was okay to marry her that soon. In addition to the fact that Jackie makes him the happiest man, Ben is confident that she will be a perfect step-mom to his two kids, Aoife who is seven and Tadhg who is 4 years old. He said that Jackie was a great human being and she would make his kids happy. He described her as funny, intelligent, generous, charming, kind and energetic among other positive adjectives. He could not hide his excitement.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f88a7865d2b40d77.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>3 ways Nigerian men reacted when they saw their wives just gave birth, 1 wanted to run to Benin Republic</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After all, it seems that his ex-wife, The Saturdays singer Una Healy, gave him her full blessings. Ben Foden and Una Healy had been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married for 6 years</a> before splitting in July 2018 after the much talked about the alleged Ben Foden affair. Ben Foden Una Healy celebrity marriage crumbled and it was alleged that Una left the rugby star because he had cheated on her.

According to him, even Una Healy blessed him for taking the step and that is all that matters.</p><h3>Where was the wedding held?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/364ecc28a07c49ae.jpg><p class=align-left>After meeting through a mutual friend, who Ben is grateful to, the two lovebirds married 2 weeks later in a yacht in Nantucket, Massachusetts.

He went on to declare his love for his new woman and express his excitement for the future life they were going to lead in future.
