William made calls to small charities in Yorkshire and Wales in order to thank those who volunteer for them for their hard work, and in a brief moment, the Duke was spotted clutching onto his mobile phone. Perhaps he was waiting for a text from a family member? Or maybe he was simply using the device to keep track of who he was talking to, he did make a lot of calls, after all. &nbsp;</p><p id=eDQQWBBekOcf><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>How Kate Middleton nails diplomatic dressing during her royal tours</a></strong></p><p id=e72LWcLrp6ON></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8342d2aa4844-prince-harry-on-phone-a.jpg><h2>The Duke of Sussex &nbsp;</h2><p id=emUzC-3OBP7n>Instagram turned&nbsp;ten last&nbsp;year (we're just as shocked) but before Prince Harry launched his now-defunct official page alongside wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, @SussexRoyal, in 2019, who's to say he didn't have a sneaky private account to keep in touch with all of his Eton boys – or polo players, or A-list friends, we could go on… Back in 2015, Harry looked particularly engrossed in his phone, much to the amusement of older brother Prince William.
