And for two years he shows up for hearings.</p><p>"He's making his court appearances," Manzella said.</p><p>“Until one day, he does not.”</p><p>This was in January 2015.</p><p>Emptying his safety deposit box, Chadwick fled to Mexico again, but he could not be tracked this time.</p><h2>MOST WANTED LIST</h2><p>Six years after the murder of QC Chadwick, a podcast was launched by a new sergeant at the Newport Beach Police Department, Court Depweg.</p><p>After the first episode of "Countdown to Capture" in September 2018, the police began receiving tips about Chadwick's disappearance; they even offered a $100,000 reward for his capture.</p><p>Peter Chadwick was placed on the US Marshall 15 Most Wanted list.</p><p>At the end of the last podcast episode, Depweg sends a final message to Peter, who had been on the run for more than three years.</p><p>“Peter, end this now,” Depweg said.</p><p>“We are coming for you. This begins your countdown to capture.”</p><p>After receiving tips and using their solid investigative background, the US Marshalls and the Mexican Federales learned that Peter ran to Mexico.</p><p>Police were able to track down his location after Peter made a call from Cholula, Mexico - 2,000 miles from Newport Beach, California.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When he was arrested in August 2019, Peter had already settled in the country for nearly five years.</p><p>He is currently serving 15 years to life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdmaYZ5hZNqZqatopmys3nIp62eq6SetKLAyKilZp6RoratxYyppp2bkajBbrzErZyrZaGYeqS0wJ2uopubZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
