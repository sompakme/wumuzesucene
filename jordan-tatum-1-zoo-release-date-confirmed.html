Overall, Tatum is certainly deserving of his very own signature. After all, he is a superstar player who has led his team to the NBA Finals. There is a very good chance that he wins a championship before the end of his career, and the fanfare around him is palpable. Consequently, one would have to assume that his signature shoe will do quite well out on the market.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout the next few months, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fans can expect a wide array of Jordan Tatum 1s to hit the market.</a> Jordan Brand has already teased a few colorways, and fans are ready for these. Tatum has been showcasing the shoes on the court, which has only increased the hype. Moreover, the silhouette is a bit more ambitious than what we've seen from the likes of Luka Doncic and Ja Morant. Simply put, sneakerheads are ecstatic about what Tatum is about to do. First stop, however, is this "Zoo" colorway.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-zoo-jordan-tatum-1>"Zoo" Jordan Tatum 1</h2></span><p>Image via SneakerBarDetroit</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Jordan Tatum 1 "Zoo" is a color scheme that had already been shown off. Thanks to SneakerBarDetroit, we now have a fresh look at this scheme and what fans can expect of it. Firstly, the upper is covered in black material. Secondly, the back heel is black with some red overlays that contain a unique design. A gold Jumpman logo is then placed in the middle of the heel. Perhaps the most interesting element here is the midsole which goes upward into the side panels. It creates a unique feel that we haven't seen in some time.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for the release date, it has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">confirmed</a> that this silhouette will drop on April 7th for $120 USD. In terms of basketball shoes, this is actually quite affordable, which is great news for consumers. Only time will tell whether or not these are a huge hit. Let us know what you think of these shoes, in the comments section below.
