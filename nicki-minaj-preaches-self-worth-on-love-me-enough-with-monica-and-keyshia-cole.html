However, you can still get any of the alternate cover arts on vinyl. It seems that each D2C digital version is available until the next one comes out. For example, yesterday Nicki put out the D2C Version 1 with the remix of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Beep Beep"</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a>. However, that digital copy is not available anymore as Version 2 is now in its place.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-love-me-enough-by-nicki-minaj-monica-and-keyshia-cole>Listen To "Love Me Enough" By Nicki Minaj, <a href=# class=text-word>Monica</a>, And <a href=# class=text-word>Keyshia Cole</a></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The song that coincides with this unique copy is "Love Me Enough." It features two of the female R&B powerhouses from the 2000s, Monica and Keyshia Cole. This is the ultimate women empowerment song that urges them to love themselves, even if they are alone. Both singers booming vocals add to the energy the record is giving off and it seems like it could have been one to make the original release of PF2. Also, each of these D2C tracks are only available on Nicki's website.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new song, "Love Me Enough," by Nicki Minaj, Monica, and Keyshia Cole?
