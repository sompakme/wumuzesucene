It sits on a hill looking down on to green Algarve countryside. There are seven suites (white walls, high ceilings, floors of handmade terracotta tiles, private terraces) in four houses around a central courtyard, with water fountain and black mosaic pool, terraces and gardens with lounge chairs, day beds and a bed hanging in a century-old oak tree. A three-course dinner of traditional Algarve cuisine made with the area’s fresh produce is served twice a week.

Everything is built from the land or salvaged and is simple (compost toilets, for example). There’s a communal kitchen and bedrooms are in funky little places that range from huts, sheds and tipis to more solid structures such as the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Birdhouse</a> and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Phaedra</a>, which has three bedrooms. Founded by British artist <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Tom Leamon</a> and a group of friends, the Beekeepers is on land belonging to Quinta da Fornalha, an award-winning biodynamic farm, with olive, carob and fruit trees. The idea is that guests embrace the environment (there’s no air conditioning) and the collective of compassionate souls help in this, with hypnotherapy, yoga classes, bike tours, fishing, birdwatching and, of course, painting. The Beekeepers “is open to individuals who wish to stay and develop their own practice, specific events, group trips and residencies”.<br><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Doubles from €561 for three nights in June, prices are negotiable – not least for those who “bring value”, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">thebeekeepers.info</a></p><h2 id=companhia-das-culturas>Companhia das Culturas</h2><figure id=8eefff13-9c77-4619-90ff-1c3aef6808af data-spacefinder-role=showcase data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-5h0uf4><span class=dcr-15haadn></span> Photograph: Francisco Nogueira</figure><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>The breakfast here is beautiful (as are the dinners) and includes figs, guava and pitanga (also known as Suriname or Brazilian cherry), cheeses, jams and fruit juice.

Just outside Castro Marim, this stylish but minimalist place has a wonderful hammam where guests can steam and bake and plunge in a structure that reflects the Moorish occupation and influence in Portugal.

There are also wine tastings, and lunches at the “farmer’s table”, under a 2,000-year-old tree that overlooks old negramole vines.

Swimming, canoeing (canoes and paddleboards are included in the price) and fishing are available and Frank is a professional birdwatching guide who can advise on or lead spotting trips in the nearby cork forests.

The restaurant, Cozinha da Clara – named after owner Sophia Berqvist’s grandmother, who was given the quinta as a christening gift – uses produce from its own gardens and has a terrace overlooking the river. The more casual Tim’s Terrace has the same astonishing views, but serves pizza and barbecue.
