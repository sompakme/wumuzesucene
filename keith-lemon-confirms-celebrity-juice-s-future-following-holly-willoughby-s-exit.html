Lots of names have been put in a pot and sent to television people, to the TV bigwigs, and I guess they'll decide from the names that we have chosen." He added: "It's not an easy job though do you know? It depends how drunk I am whether or not it's easy. [But] it's a good job.

She never usually rings me so I thought she is going to tell me she's pregnant. She said, 'I've got something to tell you. This is like breaking up with a boyfriend.' I said, 'You're going to tell me you're leaving, aren't you?' and she said, 'Yes, it's been 12 great years but I want to spend time with the family.'" I'm gutted, she was like my TV sister. She's welcome back any time. I'll properly miss her."&nbsp;</p><p id=emTx85-orFnY data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Holly Willoughby confirms Celebrity Juice departure after 12 years in emotional post</a></strong></p><p id=eqKNJzZXL7wj data-wc=83>The This Morning presenter confirmed the sad news on her Instagram.
