He may have a lot of interest from Impact Wrestling <a href=#>and the NWA</a>, but money is an issue with them. That being said, CM Punk is still making plans to get himself out there.</p><p>While currently a free agent in the professional wrestling market, CM Punk is pursuing his second passion in MMA while awaiting developments in the world of pro wrestling. This including him taking part in a special upcoming event.</p><p>CM Punk regularly provides commentary for the Cage Fury Fighting Championships promotion. He seems to really enjoy that gig, <a href=#>and it doesn’t appear that will be slowing down for him</a>.</p><p>CM Punk had two MMA fights for the UFC, with a loss to Mickey Gall at UFC 203 in Cleveland, Ohio, via first-round submission in his debut. In his second bout at UFC 225, he was defeated by Mike Jackson, although the result later became a no-contest as Jackson tested positive for marijuana on fight night.</p><p>Now, former UFC Lightweight Champion Anthony Pettis is hosting the Anthony Pettis’ Fight Night event scheduled for November 19th at the Baird Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Punk is among the distinguished guests invited to the event, alongside figures like Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson, magician Criss Angel, Frank Mir, and Nate Diaz.</p><p>This is a pretty cool event to see CM Punk advertised for. We can only hope that he has a good experience, and he also gets to see one of Criss Angel’s “Mindfreak” tricks up close and personal.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>What’s your take on CM Punk in the MMA world?
