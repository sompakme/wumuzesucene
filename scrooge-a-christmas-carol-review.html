The film’s vibrant animation — the opening sequence depicts a London more colorful than it’s ever been — feels more Hanna-Barbera than Dickensian. And it soon gets downright trippy in its frenetic, science fiction-style visuals that depict Scrooge hurtling from one time dimension to the next, frequently featuring supernatural elements. The film’s style could potentially jar the sensibilities of its youngest viewers. On the other hand, this Scrooge owns an adorable dog, so there’s that, although it’s hard to imagine him shelling out his hard-earned money to feed it. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A terrific cast has been assembled, starting with <a href=# id=auto-tag_luke-evans data-tag=luke-evans>Luke Evans</a> as a Scrooge with appropriately white hair but a face smooth enough to suggest he’s had Botox. The Welsh actor does fine in the role, using his extensive theatrical musical experience to good advantage in his songs. But when <a href=# id=auto-tag_jonathan-pryce data-tag=jonathan-pryce>Jonathan Pryce</a> shows up as a truly frightening Jacob Marley, you find yourself thinking what a terrific Scrooge he would have been. Oscar-winner <a href=# id=auto-tag_olivia-colman data-tag=olivia-colman>Olivia Colman</a> voices a particularly chipper Ghost of Christmas Past, even if her character, sporting an oversized candle on top of her head, looks more like she belongs in Beauty and the Beast.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">All of the ghostly characters are depicted in exaggerated fashion. The giant-sized Ghost of Christmas Present, accompanied by tiny alien-like winged minions, brings to mind another Disney musical. As boomingly voiced by Trevor Dion Nicholas, he resembles the genie in Aladdin, a role that Nicholas played in the London production. The Ghost of Christmas Future brings the proceedings into full horror mode, with the silent, forbidding specter sporting fiery eyes (there’s so much fire on display throughout that the film seems designed for budding young pyromaniacs) and Scrooge descending to what seems to be the bowels of hell.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It’s all a bit much, really, and the constant tonal shifts from a sort of demonic Fantasia to bouncy musical numbers proves more than a bit jarring. It doesn’t help that none of the songs are particularly memorable. (Anyone remember “Happiness,” “I Like Life” or ‘Christmas Children” from the 1970 film? Didn’t think so.) There are some charming moments, particularly when Scrooge visits his past and encounters his lost love Isabel (<a href=# id=auto-tag_jessie-buckley data-tag=jessie-buckley>Jessie Buckley</a>), in this version the daughter of Mr. Fezziwig (James Cosmo). In general, Scrooge is depicted in more sympathetic fashion than usual, making his transition to full-throated holiday cheer at the end of the story less impactful. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This is certainly not a Christmas Carol for purists, and the over-the-top if undeniably imaginative animation could prove off-putting to those not already on a sugar high. But it provides a decent enough introduction to the story for younger viewers who will hopefully move on to more subtle versions of the classic tale. The film is dedicated to Bricusse, who passed away last year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2Fjqyaq6efnLJurYycn6uho6m6or%2BMnJirp5xisaqvyp6lrGVhZ4B2fpVxcG1wXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
