A lot can change in a few weeks.</p><p>Anfisa took to Instagram to announce that both she and Jorge Nava have signed with&nbsp;DWE Talent Management.</p><p>That’s the talent agency that represents a number of reality TV personalities, including the infamous Scott Disick.</p><p>if this had just been a case of Anfisa signing with "an agency," we’d assume that she’d be taking up modeling again.</p><p>After all, Anfisa was a model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>She said during the Tell All (when confronted by Loren Brovarnik) that she had only avoided modeling here in the US because Jorge had promised to take care of her and assured her that she wouldn’t need to work.</p><p>But since the two of them signed together, we suspect that we’ll be seeing a lot more of them.</p><p>It’s not hard to see why an agency would want them.</p><p>The couple is wildly controversial among 90 Day Fiance fans.</p><p><a href=#>Anfisa Arkhipchenko&nbsp;may dislike her haters</a>, but being hated (up to a point) can be a recipe for success in this business.</p><p>For Anfisa, this is an opportunity to be closer to that which she loves most — the thing that made her come to America in the first place:</p><p>Money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For Jorge, this sounds like an opportunity to get out of debt (if he hasn’t already, with that 90 Day Fiance money).</p><p>And maybe to further rekindle his relationship with Anfisa.</p><p>If that’s really what he wants.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WGcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5krKyRp3qiusWiqpplkae4qbXPnJ%2BeppukerS1xqecnWWkpHqiuoyanp6mk656o63CpGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
