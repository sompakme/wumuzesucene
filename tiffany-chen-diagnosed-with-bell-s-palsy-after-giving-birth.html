Then I realized my face just felt weird. I didn’t know what the feeling was that I was having,” she told King.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Chen also noticed changes in the way her face appeared. “I looked in the mirror when I got home. It was like everything was starting to just fall down on itself,” she recalled. “Like my face is melting on itself.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The symptoms began to worsen “a week after giving birth” —&nbsp;a time when Chen says “it all began to hit.” That ultimately prompted her to seek medical attention. “I called my doctor and I said I was trying to eat. I wanted to put just a fork of food in my mouth, and everything came out. I couldn’t eat. Then I was starting to slur,” she said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The interview marks the first time Chen has spoken about the condition, which at one point impacted her ability to eat. “They put me to go right to the hospital, admitted me and I lost all facial function the minute I got into the hospital,” she recalled to King.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>De Niro confirmed the birth</a> of his and Chen’s baby back in early May during an interview promoting his new film About My Father. The previous month, paparazzi had captured&nbsp;photos&nbsp;of the duo, including Chen with a baby bump, exiting Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica with Billy Crystal and Harvey Keitel. Gia is De Niro’s seventh child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeknrOnrc2yZJyglaN6pbXAoKWoq5WZeqOxy6WqZqiRocC6eZBram5tY2qAcoOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
