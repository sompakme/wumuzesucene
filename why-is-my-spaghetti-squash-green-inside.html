The skin of a ripe spaghetti squash is yellow and hard, which indicates that the squash is ripe. Squash should be thoroughly cleaned and dried. After that, simply place them in a warm, sunny location to ripen, with the green side facing the sunlight. Turning the squash every few days will allow the sun to ripen all of the squash’s sides at the same time.
