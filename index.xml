Answer
What does it mean when the lights on my battery flash red, green, and white? Typically, this is caused by a connection issue. A small amount of debris can occasionally cause a connection issue, resulting in the pen reaching its maximum capability. In addition, it’s possible that some debris has gotten into the connection between the battery and the charger.
People have also inquired as to why their vape is flashing white.</description></item><item><title>4</title><link>/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%81%8F%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B4%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AE%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97-%E7%B1%B3%E5%B0%82%E9%96%80%E5%AE%B6%E3%81%8C%E7%97%87%E7%8A%B6%E3%81%A8%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E8%A7%A3%E8%AA%AC-%E3%83%8F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%8D%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%81%8F%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B4%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AE%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97-%E7%B1%B3%E5%B0%82%E9%96%80%E5%AE%B6%E3%81%8C%E7%97%87%E7%8A%B6%E3%81%A8%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E8%A7%A3%E8%AA%AC-%E3%83%8F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%91.html</guid><description>せきにはいろいろあるが、どれ一つとして気分がいいものではない。痰（たん）が出るせきや痛みを伴う空せきなどあるが、せきは体が自らを守ろうとしているのだとアメリカの聖ジョセフ病院の呼吸器科医であるレイモンド・カシアリ医師は説明する。
「せきをする時は、体が病気の原因になるものを肺から押し上げようとしているのです」と言うのはマーシー・パーソナル・フィジシャンの一次診療医、ジェオン・ライアー医師だ。
とは言え、せきの根本にある原因は幅広く、それを正確に知ることが治療に役に立つ。
もっともよくあるせきのタイプせきの主なタイプや症状、治療についてまとめてみた。
空せき（痰を伴わないせき）せきについて：アメリカ疾病予防管理センター（CDC）によると、粘液や鬱血のないせきを通常「空せき」という。気道や喉、胸が痛む場合があるとライアー医師は説明する。
原因：喘息や咽頭炎、副鼻腔炎、胃食道逆流性症（GERD）、新型コロナウイルスなど、原因の可能性はさまざま。
治療法：「空せきの治療法は主に原因次第だ」とラトガース大学看護学校のエイリーン・M・ホームズ臨床准教授は言う。
また、ライアー医師は「喘息で空せきに苦しんでいる場合、現在の治療プランに微調整が必要かもしれないので、医師と相談しましょう」とアドバイス。
加えてCDCによると、ウイルス性の咽頭炎の場合はトローチを舐める、もしくは水分をたくさん摂るなど補助的治療をしながらウイルスが出るのを待つしかないという。もし、胃食道逆流症が疑われる場合は、胃の制酸薬を服用して様子を見ておくこと。
空せきは通常、肺が乾いて炎症を起こしているサインであるため、睡眠中は加湿器をかけて肺を鎮めることをライアー医師は勧める。
また、新型コロナウイルスの疑いがある場合は、自宅ですぐできる抗原検査かPCR検査を受けること。
痰を伴うせきBrothers91//Getty Images
せきについて：ホームズ准教授によると、粘液や、肺か喉の奥に鬱血があるので、「喀痰（かくたん）」とも呼ばれているという。
原因：「痰を伴うせきは、肺が感染症にかかっているサインとしてもっとも多いものです。肺炎や気管支炎、あるいは他の原因の可能性もあります」とライアー医師。
だが、必ずしも重度の感染症の兆候とは限らない。特に喘息や慢性閉塞性肺疾患（COPD）など肺の基礎疾患がある場合は、せき風邪でも痰を伴う可能性があるという。
治療法：ホームズ准教授は「症状の深刻度によって適切な治療法は異なります」と説明する。だが、透明な粘液が出てくるなら、感染症の可能性は少ないのだそう。
その場合は、症状に注意して、水をたくさん飲むかカフェインフリーのお茶に蜂蜜を入れて飲むなど補助的治療をするだけで大丈夫だ。
しかし、黄色または緑色の痰が出る場合は、抗生物質が必要かもしれないので、医師の診察を受けること。
コントロールできないせきせきについて：「発作性せき」と言われるもの。「せきが出始めるとずっと続くが何も出てきません。横隔膜がけいれんを起こすので非常に体力を消耗します」とホームズ准教授。
ライアー医師によると、せきがあまりに激しくて吐いてしまう人もいるという。
原因：百日せきの可能性が大いにあり、最近、大人によく見られるとカシアリ医師は言う。喘息や慢性閉塞性肺疾患、肺炎もこのせきの原因だ。
治療法：自分でなんとかしようとしても無理なせきだ。「医師に相談する必要があります。通常、市販薬で治るものではありません」とホームズ准教授は説明する。
犬吠様のせきせきについて：「非常に粗暴な音で痰を伴い、まるで犬やオットセイが吠えているように聞こえます」とライアー医師。
考えられる原因：咽頭から肺につながる気管が腫れているため、吠えているような音がするとホームズ准教授は言う。
また、ライアー医師は「呼吸器感染症の可能性がありますが、百日せきの典型的なサインでもあります」と説明する。
治療法：これも医師による治療が必要で、できるだけ早いほうがいい。「腫れが続いたり悪化させたくはないですよね」とホームズ准教授。
せきで医師の治療が必要なタイミングは？RunPhoto//Getty Images
せきが3週間以上続く場合は、いつでも医師の診察を受けて欲しいとカシアリ医師は勧める。また、せきが日常生活に支障をきたしていると感じたり、せきと共に痰がたくさん出たり血液が出たりする場合は、なるべく早く病院に行くこと。

Answer
On average, you can anticipate a 50cc scooter to last anywhere between 20,000 and 30,000 kilometres on a single charge.
The same may be said about the lifespan of scooter engines. An air-cooled 50cc scooter’s usable engine life before it has to be rebuilt is probably not much more than ten thousand kilometres. If properly maintained, a water-cooled scooter such as the Vespa GTS/ or 300 series should live for 50,000 miles or more in most cases.</description></item><item><title>Marla Tellez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</title><link>/marla-tellez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/marla-tellez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html</guid><description>Marla Tellez is a Los Angeles, California-based news anchor for KTTV-TV.
