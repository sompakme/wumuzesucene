Tim McGraw is not any different. Of his five tattoos, two are tied to his unwavering religious beliefs, like his&nbsp;Ichthys ink, otherwise called the "Jesus Fish," a symbol of Christianity. The Ichthys is next to his "Jan 07" tat, the meaning of which is unclear. However, it could be a nod to his single "Last&nbsp;Dollar (Fly&nbsp;Away)," which was released in January 2007.</p><p dir=ltr>Of course, the huge religious symbol on McGraw's arm should&nbsp;come as no surprise seeing the singer and his wife have been very vocal about their religious views in the past. Speaking to <a href=#>Esquire</a> in 2021, McGraw gave his own definition of faith saying, "Blind faith is not true faith. Asking questions and constantly dissecting faith—and still having faith? That represents a truer faith." Speaking of faith — Faith Hill, that is — McGraw wife's name is inscribed on his upper right arm — proof of his love and total commitment. In a 2006 interview with People, McGraw teased Faith about getting a tattoo of his name — and when she declined, he protested, "But, baby, look at my tattoo! That shows how much I love you."</p><p dir=ltr>McGraw's fourth tattoo — an ornate cross, is in honor of his family with the different letters on it representing the initials of their three daughters. Additionally, the "I Need You" singer has a "DHD" text on his right leg, an acronym for DanceHall Doctors from his seventh studio album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWpkaYJ1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ptq55zJyeq5mnqHq1rdOtpqirXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
