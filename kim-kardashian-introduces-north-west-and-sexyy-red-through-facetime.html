She showed that off in a recent episode of The Kardashians which covered the MET Gala. She wasn't afraid to tell her mom <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kim Kardashian</a> that the very real and expensive pearls on her dress looked fake. But that was nothing compared to the critiques she had for other celebrities at the event itself. Watching from home she picked apart outfits from stars like Pete Davidson and Jared Leto.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But one celebrity whom North did seem starstruck to meet was <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a>. When Kim and Red ran into each other at an event over the weekend, the reality TV star had to let North know. In a video making the rounds online Red thanks North for being a fan and listening to her songs. It sparked plenty of debate online as to whether or not North should be listening to Sexyy Red's music at all. Some expressed their issue with it given the sexual nature of much of Red's music. But plenty also reminisced on some of the explicit music they were listening to at a young age that wasn't all that different. Check out the video of their encounter and the fan debate over it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kim-kardashian-facetiming-north-west-with-sexyy-red>Kim Kardashian Facetiming North West With Sexyy Red</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In another clip reacting to the MET Gala, North took issue with a different rapper. She <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">accused City Girls rapper Yung Miami of "copying" Kim Kardashian</a> with the pearls she used to accent her dress. Fans found the moment particularly funny, especially in contrast with her critiques of the dress and the pearls in particular before Kim left for the event.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That came just a few weeks after she made waves online for another far stranger clip. In a different video from The Kardashians North <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">eats an onion like it's an apple</a> and Kim's lack of a shocked reaction implies it's something she does regularly. What do you think of North West being so excited to meet Sexyy Red over Facetime?
