Thom Vernon, the company’s creator, had the inspiration for the concept when developing a house for himself and his family and ran upon a problem.</p><p></p><h3><b>Where do Big Chill appliances get their start?</b></h3><p>Big Chill is celebrating the birthday of the United States of America! Retro-inspired appliances pay tribute to this country’s proud history as well as its bright prospects for the future. Our stoves, which are designed to transport you back in time to the 1950s, are made in Reading, Pennsylvania, and each of our refrigerators is constructed by hand in Boulder, Colorado.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>What is the function of AC Pro?</b></h3><p>This product works by having you put a can into the air conditioner in your vehicle and simply replenish the system with R-134a refrigerant as well as the required lubricants to rejuvenate old seals and moving components.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><h3><b>Is it possible to re-use AC recharge?</b></h3><p>In order to reuse refrigeration fluid, it must first be properly recycled or reclaimed before it can be put back into service, even if it is being returned to the vehicle from which it was originally extracted.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>What is the best way to tell whether my refrigerant is completely depleted?</b></h3><p>Freon that has been left over does not escape into the atmosphere. Tighten down the can tap and leave the tool on the can to prevent leakage. When a can is empty, you can tell by the fact that it feels empty when you shake it. Make sure the tap is closed before you begin removing the hose from the fitting.</p><p></p><h3><b>What is the location of the low pressure port?</b></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This valve is positioned on the low pressure (suction) side of the system, in the line that travels from the compressor through the evaporator (firewall) and up to the condensor on that side of the system.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><b>How much should I increase the concentration of 134a?</b></h3><p>Most current passenger automobile air conditioning systems do not carry a lot of refrigerant (approximately 14 to 28 ounces), so you don’t want to add too much if the system is running low on coolant. In most cases, one can of R134a contains 12 ounces of refrigerant.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBllKR6urvUZqysnV2Xtqh5wqGgpaRdp7KnvsignKuZnql7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
