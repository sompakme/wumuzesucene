That was a weird coincidence," he later told <i>Vice</i>.</p><p>"At a ceremony, a heart-shaped rose quartz crystal was on the altar, and synchronistically, this whole thing happened. It's a long story, but basically the crystal jumped off the altar and skipped on camera. That was weird."</p><p>In May 2014, Keegan leased the building he'd felt so connected to and launched his own new age temple called Full Circle, into which he claimed he sank $150,000 — or "everything" he had.</p><p>According to Keegan, the idea behind Full Circle was for "enlightened" members to gather at the temple to initiate change through events like concerts, political gatherings for self-help gurus, sit-ins and workshops.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The organisation briefly closed down in early 2017 as funding dried-up, before being granted a last-minute reprieve when an investor came on-board.</p><p>Unfortunately for Keegan, it was only a stay of execution, and just a few months later, Full Circle vacated the Rose Temple for good.</p><h2 class=article__heading>HOLLYWOOD DARLINGS</h2><p>In the past couple of years, Keegan's appeared in a couple of short films, and — most notably — the surprise comedy hit, <i>Hollywood Darlings</i> (currently streaming on Netflix).</p><p>The faux-reality series stars former '80s and '90s child stars Beverley Mitchell (<i>7th Heaven</i>), Christine Lakin (<i>Step By Step</i>) and Jodie Sweetin (<i>Full House</i>), who play exaggerated versions of themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/NodfuMh5pHm6zC-BnH2sh6Jkf3o=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/3XYQM54HVHVSXCX6VBABNCU5FM.jpg"><p>Given his former teen heart-throb status and recent spiritual turn, Keegan was an easy choice to guest star.</p><p>"It was fun to take the opportunity to play to what some people think I do now, so why not have fun with it," Keegan said at the show's premiere.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"This was the perfect venue to explore that creatively.
