Don't put yourself in danger. It's very crucial that you get your feelings out - but don't ever inflict harm on your own body because your body is so sacred. I wish I could tell every young girl with an eating disorder, or who has harmed herself in any way, that she's worthy of life and that her life has meaning. You can overcome and get through anything."<p id=eSyG0VFQy9BY>Photo: © Instagram/@ddlovato</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7b4ff5b4d99-gallery11-a.jpg> The 25-year-old singer is a voice for self-esteem and body positivity. Taking to Twitter, Demi wrote to her fans: "Instead of looking in the mirror and focusing on your flaws, look in the mirror and appreciate your best features... everyone has them."<p id=e4YHD-Mswo9r>Photo: © Instagram/@ddlovato</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/148720f71732-gallery11-a.jpg> After getting out of treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, Demi had an interview and photoshoot with and opened up about tattoos she has that cover scars from self-harm. "I think scars are like battle wounds—beautiful, in a way. They show what you've been through and how strong you are for coming out of it. My tattoos say 'Stay strong.' 'Stay' on one [wrist] and 'strong' on the other," she told the publication. "Now I'm able to look at them and be thankful for being alive. I think that I've been blessed over the past year to be able to start over."<p id=eiKHeuP6yTAN>Photo: © Instagram/@ddlovato</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4786e81602eb-gallery11-a.jpg> One of Demi's Instagram posts really resonated with her fans. She shared a photo of herself in a bathing suit while on vacation, opening up in the caption about her struggle with disordered eating: "So, I’m insecure about my legs in this picture but I’m posting it because I look so happy and this year I’ve decided I’m letting go of my perfectionism and embracing freedom from self criticism. Learning to love my body the way it is is challenging but life changing. Giving up my eating disorder has been the most challenging journey of my life but I work every day towards solid recovery even if I mess up sometimes. Today I’m feeling strong. You all can do it too. It IS possible. Thank you God for this new chapter in my life. #EDrecovery #happyAF"<p id=eTjYTJHXBIbM>Photo: © Instagram/@ddlovato</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eeda3f23bc61-gallery11-a.jpg> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Latina</a> asked Demi what prompted her to share that photo and message. The "Sorry Not Sorry" singer responded: "I keep hearing this “thigh gap” thing and when you hear it so many times it starts to get embedded into your head. I think it’s important that somebody says, “Hey if you don’t have this, it doesn’t mean that you’re not beautiful and it doesn’t mean that you don’t have a beautiful body.” I don’t naturally have one, but I feel really confident in my shape and I’ve worked on it and gotten to a really healthy place. I know that I may not have one, but I’ve come really far and I’m proud of the body that I’m in today — and I just want women to feel that way as well."<p id=eWhN2K-Wt9jo>Photo: © Instagram/@ddlovato</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37a88ec9e2c1-gallery11-a.jpg> Demi, who has suffered from bulimia and anorexia, opened up to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Fitness magazine</a> about her struggle with body image. "We all have problem areas. I'm always going to have thick thighs. I can't change that, and obsessing over it will only make me miserable. Learning to be grateful for our bodies and taking care of them are the best ways for us to empower ourselves physically, mentally, and spiritually."<p id=eIIb15AsFGy2>Photo: © C Flanigan/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99133ac19dcf-gallery11-a.jpg> Back in 2014, the singer <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>took to Twitter</a> to share some of her inspiring wisdom: "You CAN turn your life around. You can go through hell AND BACK. It IS possible. NEVER underestimate yourself.
