Jacob adds of Chee's debut nonfiction collection: "It talks about how to be a queer Asian American artist and I've never felt so held and seen," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-collected-schizophrenias-by-esm-weijun-wang></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Collected Schizophrenias by Esmé Weijun Wang</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wang writes about her experiences with mental and chronic illness, including its impact on her life and how terminology has impacted the medical community as a whole.

In some essays, she also reflects on the key moments of her life: experiencing mental burnout and a schizophrenic episode, among others. Above all, Pham writes a story of connection and finding home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-good-talk-a-memoir-in-conversations-by-mira-jacob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Good Talk: A Memoir in Conversations by Mira Jacob</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jacob was inspired to write Good Talk after conversations with her 6-year-old son, who is Jewish and Indian American, about race.
