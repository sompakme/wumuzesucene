Sadly for the Sussexes, new reports show that even the Unicorn startup is on the rocks. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-harry-1.jpg alt="Prince Harry on stage for Global Citizen Concert 2021 NYC - Part 2, The Great Lawn in Central Park, New York, NY September 25, 2021." height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Prince Harry's Reported Reaction to ESPYs Backlash Shows How Personal the Criticism Was</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to a feature from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Daily Beast</a>, the company has suffered some major changes to its strategy and staff recently after not reaching its previous revenue goals. In fact, according to two sources “familiar with BetterUp’s finances,” the company was “nowhere close” to its objectives. “They were counting on really big expansion numbers,” the sources revealed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Amid the struggles, Harry, who took the CIO position in April of 2021, has been an obvious scapegoat among employees. “At first I was like, ‘This is cool,'” one staffer remembered, adding that, with time, the royal’s presence has “been more of a distraction.” Another staffer added that Harry’s responsibilities within the company are a bit murky, saying that his workload includes “going to go with zero things.” Ouch!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Every article mentions his role at BetterUp, then goes on to roast [him and Markle],” another source added. Another source echoed those sentiments, saying, “The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Those opinions, however, are not across the board among the employees. Per Daily Beast, many other staffers admitted Harry’s work “helped the company increase its reach in Europe” and helped “close major deals.” <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-harry-1.jpg alt="Prince Harry on stage for Global Citizen Concert 2021 NYC - Part 2, The Great Lawn in Central Park, New York, NY September 25, 2021." height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Prince Harry's Reported Reaction to ESPYs Backlash Shows How Personal the Criticism Was</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Regardless of who is to blame, it’s safe to say BetterUp is in trouble. Per the outlet, the company recently laid off 16% of its staff after “months of turbulence” without so much as a warning. “People would just be there one day, and then they’d be gone the next,” one source revealed. “My boss one day was just deactivated on Slack. That just started happening in various pockets of the business.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see more of Meghan Markle & Prince Harry’s milestones since leaving the royal family.&nbsp;</strong><br><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/meghan-harry-accomplishments.jpg alt width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamhnhHaAl2inq6GemLJutMCrqbJlkprBtbHRrqdmqp%2Bhsm64wLKmn56jZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
