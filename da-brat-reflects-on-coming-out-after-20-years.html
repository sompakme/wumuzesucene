And when you get with somebody, you have to meet in the middle. So to me, the middle was just letting everybody know: ‘Hey, she’s the one'." Brat also explained how the decision to make the announcement was spontaneous, a simple celebration of love.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Jesseca was showing me some pictures and we were going back and forth, joking ‘I’ll post it,’ ‘No, I’ll post it.’ So when she did, I was like, ‘Oh sh–! I just came out after 20-something years!’ But it feels good to share with the world when you’re happy," continues Brat, who remembers when people weren't so accepting within the industry. "“I was always told you want to be fuckable to men and women to sell records — you don’t want anybody to discriminate. It was absolutely my decision. I mean, you saw what happened to people like Ellen: Remember when she lost her TV show, and all these horrible things were happening? People were totally against it.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out the entire Variety interview <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">right here</a>, and show some love for Da Brat for keeping true to herself.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
