With an aim to win the championship on Kye’s side, Pat told Kye not to blow his motor, and that they were going easy on him.</p><p>As a result, Kye is thought to have held back and Lizzy beat him. She said it was the “worst case scenario” and that the race was a “do or die moment.” She also said she “didn’t want to go over there” to speak to her fiance after the win.</p><p>She explained that they “turned the sticks on the way it was, even if it was just a little bit.” Lizzy winning the race meant Kye has not gone through to the championships but was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warned</a> that if she let him win, it would let the sport down.</p><p>The argument led to Kye and Lizzy facing breakup rumors, but they are still together. Just three weeks ago, Lizzy and Kelley were seen enjoying Thanksgiving together, as shared on the racer’s YouTube on November 28, 2022.</p><p><strong>GRV Media and Reality Titbit contacted Kye and Lizzy for comment on the breakup rumors.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-are-kye-and-lizzy-getting-married>When are Kye and Lizzy getting married?</h2><p>Kye and Lizzy are getting married on November 11, 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zola</a> reports.

However, the happy couple’s initial special day was set to take place four months after Lizzy’s Bachelorette party in July 2022.</p><p>Therefore, it appears the couple has postponed their wedding by a year. The special day is set to take place in Kentwood, Los Angeles, with a registry allowing their loved ones to contribute to their first getaway together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"A champion doesn't beg for a win."😳<br>📺 <a href=#>#StreetOutlaws</a>: No Prep Kings<br>🗓 Mondays at 8p ET on <a href=#>@Discovery</a> and <a href=#>@discoveryplus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bboZ1G7Lxz</a></p>— Street Outlaws (@StreetOutlaws) <a href=#>December 20, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kye-and-lizzy-on-honeymoon-amid-breakup-rumors>Kye and Lizzy on honeymoon amid breakup rumors</h2><p>Lizzy shared a series of videos to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram Story</a> on December 20.
