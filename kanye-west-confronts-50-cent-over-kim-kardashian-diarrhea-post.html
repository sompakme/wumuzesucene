On Friday, 50 shared a doctored post which had been making the rounds on the internet. It was styled to look like it was from West's Instagram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Kim has diarrhea a lot," the post read. "Like way more than a normal person should have it." 50 Cent then captioned the fake post. "What the f**k make you do this, smh," he wrote. "Not liquor nah. That boy on dat branson!"</p><p>Kanye was quick to respond in 50's comment section. "I ain't write this bro," he wrote. 50 Cent has since deleted the post.</p><p>Kanye had already disavowed the fake message, writing on his own account that it wasn't real&nbsp;but that he appreciated comedy. The doctored post prompted Ye to begin talking about his own favorite comedians. Some of the best, he said, were, "Me Mitch Hedberg Anthony Jeselnik Louis CK Jerrod Carmichael Deray JP Smooth&nbsp;<a href=# class=text-word rel>Mase</a>&nbsp;Elon Musk 50 Justin LaBoy&nbsp;<a href=# class=text-word rel>GLC</a>&nbsp;Eddie Murphy Sakiya Sandifer Chris Rock Larry David Kevin Hart (In Jumanji) and of course King David Dave Chapelle."</p><p>As of writing, West has cleaned up his account after spending weeks on IG calling out a plethora of enemies. Now, the only post on the account is a photo of model wearing new <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> sunglasses. Ye didn't include a caption.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZ4B3g49mopqmqZp6uLHSrWScp56bv7C606xkbmhdmLKvwIyorZ6qXaC2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jJ2gmqqinbKiec%2Boqq1lnprEtA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
