The song became a huge hit thanks to Hayes' daughter Lela, who helped him put together a <a href=#>TikTok dance</a> for the track, and graciously performed it with him. People everywhere began to recreate the dance, while others (<a href=#>hundreds of thousands of them</a>) simply used the sound for their own videos.</p><p dir=ltr>So how did a song about a date night at Applebee's not only make Hayes exponentially more famous than he was, but also land him a crossover song with <a href=#>Kesha</a>? He called her, of course, simple as that. "The first time we talked on the phone, she said, 'My best girlfriend got in a fist fight at Applebee's,'" Hayes told <a href=#>People</a> of Kesha, who <a href=#>already knew</a> the song. "And I was like, 'Kesha, you just sealed the deal. That's it. You're perfect for this.'"</p><p>The über-relatable song has sparked something of a phenomenon, and even landed Hayes a "paid partnership" with the neighborhood restaurant chain that apparently <a href=#>includes sharing Instagram posts</a>. But Hayes always keeps it real, and for him, that's the secret to the song's success. People are "surprised that I drive a Nissan and we just live in a neighborhood," he tells <a href=#>Forbes</a>. "They think most artists who do this for a living live in a mansion and drive Lamborghini yachts."
