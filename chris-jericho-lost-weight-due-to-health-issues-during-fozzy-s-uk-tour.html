I had a little bit of a health issue when we toured England in December. When it happened and things were cool, I just decided to kind of do a reconfiguration of the lifestyle, shall we say. I went on a diet, a strict diet, and I wanted to lose 10 pounds, I lost 10 pounds in a week. So I thought, well, let me just stay on it and see what happens.”</p><p>Jericho had gained considerable weight prior to his UK tour with Fozzy. The former AEW World Champion was even dragged on the internet for his bloated physique, but got the last laugh by undergoing a tremendous transformation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jericho returned to AEW during the company’s New Year Smash special on December 29, 2021</a>. The 51-year-old looked absolutely shredded as he rushed to the ring to prevent 2PointO and Daniel Garcia’s further beatdown of Eddie Kingston, Santana and Ortiz.</p><p>Jericho would turn heel in the following months and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">form the Chris Jericho Appreciation Society with Garcia, 2PointO and Jake Hagger.</a> The faction is currently embroiled in a feud with Kingston, Santana and Ortiz.</p><p><strong>What’s your take 0n this story?
