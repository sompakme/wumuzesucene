The internet battleground of opinions regarding social justice saw everyone from average users to some of the biggest celebrities in the world speak up and share their thoughts.</p><p>One celebrity whose opinion on BLM caused a bit of controversy was <strong>Terry Crews</strong>, who released a series of tweets that caused many to question his allegiance to the movement.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Crews and his controversial comments</h2><p>The first controversial tweet he shared read, <strong>"Defeating white supremacy</strong> without white people creates black supremacy. Equality is the truth. Whether we like it or not, we are all in this together."</p><p>A few weeks later, Terry tweeted another message, "If you are a <strong>child of God, you are my brother and sister. I have family of all races, creeds and ideologies.</strong> We must make sure #blacklivesmatter doesn't turn into #blacklivesbetter."</p><p>However, the actor defended his words and followed them up with more statements in which he doubled down on his views. "Any black person calling me a c-n o and uncle Tom for promoting <strong>EQUALITY is a black supremacist </strong>[sic]because they have determined who is black and who isn't," he tweeted.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>But now, Crews admits the timing of his tweets was a mistake</h2><p>"I just wanted peace. And I guess it goes back to my approval. It goes back to my need for approval, it went back to that," <strong>Crews </strong>said. "And again, it was a mistake. It was a mistake to tweet that out at that time."</p><p>"The need is for us as a people to actually come together and really, really be what we need to be to this country, because it's our country. This is our country," Crews said. "<strong>We died and fought, and I'm not giving it away.</strong> This is our inheritance."</p><p>Despite apologizing for his earlier statements, <strong>Terry has not deleted any of his 2020 tweets.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJnfHGAjmxnaG5ia7B4gsJtnGtvYGmypa6ScW%2BbbGVssm%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
