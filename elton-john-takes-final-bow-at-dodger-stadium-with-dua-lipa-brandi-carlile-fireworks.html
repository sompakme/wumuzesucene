Elton John, backed by a barrage of No. 1 albums and hit singles, hit Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for back-to-back sold-out shows.
The concerts became legendary in pre-viral times, thanks to an electric set from John, then 28, who tickled the ivories and roared into the microphone while dressed in a shimmering Bob Mackie-designed Dodgers uniform, blue sequined baseball cap and oversized white glasses. John was the first act to perform at the stadium since the Beatles in 1966, and a superstar was born."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

John was the first act to perform at the stadium since the Beatles in 1966, and a superstar was born. “In October, 1975, no one was bigger than Elton John. He was like Elvis at the height of his career,” Terry O’Neill, the photographer responsible for the iconic images of the Dodger Stadium shows, once reflected. “Elton still is one of the most talented people I’ve ever met and he gave his all at those concerts.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/EJ033-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">John, now 75, gave Los Angeles his all one last time, closing out a three-show run Sunday night back inside Dodger Stadium, taking a final bow as part of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour. The concert marked the legendary entertainer’s final North American tour stop — upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, Farewell Yellow Brick Road kicked off in 2018 and will wrap next July in Sweden —&nbsp;as he looks toward retirement from the road.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a highly decorated career that spans 50-plus years and every award from Oscars to Grammys, John has been a near constant at stadiums across the globe, and he’s said that the farewell will allow him to spend more time with longtime partner David Furnish and their two sons. They made an appearance during the show’s encore after fireworks had blasted the sky and guests <a href=# id=auto-tag_dua-lipa data-tag=dua-lipa>Dua Lipa</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_brandi-carlile data-tag=brandi-carlile>Brandi Carlile</a> and Kiki Dee had joined John for special duets.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sunday night’s show — performed for a near-capacity crowd of more than 50,000 guests —&nbsp;might’ve been the last for John, but it was a first for Disney+. The streamer mounted its first-ever global live stream by presenting Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium, produced by Fulwell 73 and Rocket Entertainment for Disney Branded Television. The three-hour event featured the show in its entirety, along with a preshow package that included some of John’s famous friends.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">There were plenty in the crowd, as well. The one that drew the most eyeballs and the most selfie requests in the floor seats was JoJo Siwa, decked out in a flame-embroidered, yellow-orange Lycra jumpsuit topped by a rhinestone cap with horns, nearly identical to the one Taron Egerton wore when he played John in the biopic Rocketman.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s Elton John’s big night,” Siwa told The Hollywood Reporter before the show, adding that her favorite song of his is “The Bitch Is Back.” “I’m so excited for tonight. I don’t think anybody knows how iconic this performance is actually going to be. This performance is going down in history. It’s going to be unreal.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Seated for Elton John and just spotted Jojo Siwa who def might be best dressed audience member tonight amid a sea of Elton cosplay. “This is next level,” she tells me. “And what’s cool is people are asking for photos not because I’m Jojo Siwa but because of what I’m wearing.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/SGtNH925uo</a></p>— Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) <a href=# rel=nofollow>November 21, 2022</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also in attendance were Egerton, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Donatella Versace, H.E.R., Jude Law, Billie Jean King, Joni Mitchell, Kirsten Dunst, John Stamos, Sara Gilbert, Eric McCormack, Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka, Angela Bassett, Courtney B. Vance, Bradley Whitford, Connie Britton, Dita Von Teese, Heidi Klum, Jenna Dewan, Lucy Hale, Miles Teller, Sophia Bush, Xochitl Gomez and more. While Siwa was appropriately dressed for the occasion, so were hordes of John devotees, many of whom came dressed in sequins and feather boas, oversized glasses and plenty of sparkle.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The festivities began at 8:15 p.m. as John took to the stage to open with “Bennie and the Jets” wearing a black tuxedo with tails that was emblazoned with red, blue and silver flames on the lapelS; red diamond-encrusted glasses; and giant diamond studs in each ear.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Tonight is a very special night, we are creating history tonight,” John said, in his first remarks at the start of the show in between “Philadelphia Freedom” and “I Guess That’s Why they Call It the Blues.” “And I’m so glad to see you at Dodger Stadium.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Judging by the applause and the fact that nearly every seat was occupied, everyone was glad to see him, too. “This is a very special, very emotional night for me. It’s been a long journey,” John continued, nodding to an earlier L.A. performance that predated his Dodger Stadium debut. “I first came here to America in 1970 to the City of Angels and played the Troubadour, which thankfully is still there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He credited Los Angeles Times reviewer Robert Hilburn for his rave review that “accelerated my career.” John then launched into “Border Song,” but not before detailing how Aretha Franklin covered the song in a way that floored him and co-writer Bernie Taupin. “It was probably the most exciting thing that happened,” he said, adding that, years later, they were able to perform it together at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City in 2017, before her death the following year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He dedicated the night’s performance to “the lasting genius” of Franklin. It was among the many highlights in his set list that also included “Tiny Dancer,” “Rocket Man,” “Levon,” “Someone Saved My Life Tonight,” “I’m Still Standing,” “Candle in the Wind,” “Sad Songs (Say So Much),” “Crocodile Rock,” “Have Mercy on the Criminal” and “Burn Down the Mission.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Carlile was the first special guest to take to the stage, and she did so dressed in a gray suit with red and blue accents with a No. 1 printed on the back. She joined for a duet on “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” after John had shouted out all of his band members and dedicated the song to those who had died.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Huge applause for Brandi Carlisle (decked out in glittering suit with #1 on back) as she joins to duet with Elton John on a powerful “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” a song he dedicated to all the band members he’s lost over the years. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/YMsRXChhpz</a></p>— Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) <a href=# rel=nofollow>November 21, 2022</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Dee, whom John noted was present for his first Dodger Stadium show in 1975, then came out to relive their hit “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.” The grand finale — marked by yellow streamers shot into the sky amid a fireworks display —&nbsp;came with a rocking “Saturday Night’s Alright.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">John then disappeared for a few minutes, only to reappear during an encore wearing a custom encrusted robe by Gucci with “Dodgers” printed on the back, accessorized with another Bob Mackie original on his head. Dua Lipa joined him for a performance of their hit dance track “Cold Heart (PNAU Remix).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As the night inched closer to the final curtain call, John took a moment to revel in the accomplishment and pay tribute to the fans who helped sustain his five-decade career while also showing off the full life that awaits him on the other side.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s been 50 years of touring the United States, across all 50 states. This is my seventh concert here at Dodger Stadium. Tonight is the 271st show of the Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour and my 103rd show in the Los Angeles area,” he detailed before bringing out his final VIPs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I would also like to introduce somebody. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now. Come on out, Mr. Bernie Taupin,” he said as his longtime collaborator stepped out on the stage, greeted by a warm embrace and a kiss on the cheek. “We’ve been writing together since 1967. We still love each other more than we’ve ever done before. Amazing guy, I love you. Thank you for all the gifts.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking of gifts, John then explained why he was prepared to bid adieu to the road by bringing out those reasons, specifically his husband and their two young sons, Zachary and Elijah, all decked out in Elton John-emblazoned letter jackets.&nbsp;After waving to the crowd, the trio exited the stage as John took one last seat at the piano.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I became successful first in America, and you bought the singles and the albums, the 8-tracks, the cassettes and the CDs. More important, you bought the tickets to the shows, which I love more than anything, to play live. I want to thank you for that because you made me; without America, I wouldn’t be here. Thank you for all the years of love and generosity and loyalty.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued: “I wish you health, love, prosperity. Be kind to each other, OK? And farewell.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But he wasn’t done. John tickled the ivories one last time, stood up, walked away from the piano and removed his robe to reveal a custom Gucci tracksuit with his name printed on the back. He then stepped on a riser that lifted him toward a video screen featuring a cinematic backdrop with a yellow brick road.&nbsp;With that, he walked off into the distance as the screen faded to black.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-1442442087-copy.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BaubW7zWahqKCeYrGwsMaeqWarpJaxqsHMZpqoppOav7V5w66YZqSZpa5urtGapZ2hXZius7jIpZxmaWJognOClmlqbmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
