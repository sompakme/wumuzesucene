This is a love letter to the vitality of the theater community and the great spirit of the Tribeca Film Festival, two essential constellations that make up this universe of a city.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Presented by Tribeca in association with the Times Square Alliance and TSX Entertainment, the special event will have 300 seats available on a first-come, first-served basis at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 47th Street. Attendees can download the TSX App and tune in to the broadcast using their own phone’s speakers or with the additional use of headphones. The broadcast will feature an introduction from Bareilles, who will also be performing live following the Tribeca premiere at the BMCC.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The musical, which was nominated for four&nbsp;Tony Awards, including best&nbsp;musical, best lead actress and best original score, was based on the 2007 film written, directed by and starring Adrienne Shelly, along with leading actors Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion.
