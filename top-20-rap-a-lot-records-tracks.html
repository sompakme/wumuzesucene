Stereotypically, Gangsta Rap is viewed as vulgar, and can sometimes promote violence against women without any really basis or message.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While this is the case with some artists, many gangsta rappers did have a real message. A message about the crimes and the ghettos of America, and a strong indignation against the entities that created them.&nbsp;These rappers were rebels, unafraid to voice their opinions.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Some of hip-hop's biggest rebels were birthed by Rap-A-Lot records, which J Prince formed out of a used car lot in order to keep his little brother off the streets.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rap-A-Lot gave us the Geto Boys (who actually started out with an H in their name), rap pioneers who introduced us to Southern Hardcore Rap. the Geto Boys subsequently produced <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Scarface</a>, a member of the group, who has also had a very successful solo career. Rap-A-Lot also gave us Big Mike, Seagram (RIP), <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Devin The Dude</a>, and so many more.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Geto Boys, which currently consists of Bushwick Bill, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Scarface</a>, and Willie D, was Rap-A-Lot's first major act, while Devin The Dude, was with the label the longest at 15 years.&nbsp;Artists currently on the roster are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bun B</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Z-Ro</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In 1994, when <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Biggie</a> rapped "Not from Houston, but I Rap-A-Lot," I think it's safe to say that a lot of us weren't quite sure what he meant. The label was popular within Houston's hip-hop community, and we all knew the song "Mind Playing Tricks On Me," but to hear a New York rapper mention Rap-A-Lot was huge.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For over 20 years, J Prince put his heart and business sense into the independent label, which received backing from major labels, but the labels and the money didn't faze Rap-A-Lot's rappers. They always stayed true to their beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A lot of record labels have come and gone, but Rap-A-Lot is special. It's about heart, determination, and belief. It's about not being afraid to state your message. Rap-A-Lot brought us so much amazing music, HotNewHipHop thought it would be dope to countdown the 20 best Rap-A-Lot Records songs ever,</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Contributor&lt;/b> Layne Weiss is a writer, hip hop head and self proclaimed nerd.
