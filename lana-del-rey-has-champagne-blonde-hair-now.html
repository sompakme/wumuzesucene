Hairstylists Shelby Blankenship of the Blankenship salon in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma took to Instagram to unveil the first stages of Del Rey's champagne blond hair.</p><p>"So humbled that Lana Del Rey graced our salon to give us the opportunity to get her fixed up. This isn’t the end goal but we’re taking baby steps to get her there with keeping her hair as healthy as possible. She can literally pull off anything but I can’t wait to see this iconic champagne blonde once she gets all of the old dark color out. A true beauty," Blankenship captioned a photo of the singer.<br></p><p>According to a statement from a salon rep to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.popsugar.com.au/beauty/lana-del-rey-blond-hair-color-details-47663540 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Popsugar</a>&nbsp;about Del Rey's color process, the salon started off with babylights, using Goldwell Silklift for maximum lift, and moved on to smudging "with Redken shades EQ in between foils to blend out any old highlights." After washing her highlights, they "did a tiny shadow root with Redken shades 9M and glossed her ends with a shades 10VV and 10GI, plus clear to keep her as bright as possible."</p><p>This look is definitely a moment for the singer and we can't wait to see photos of phase two.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
