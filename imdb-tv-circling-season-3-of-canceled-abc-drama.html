Amazon-backed IMDb TV has landed free streaming rights to the first two seasons of the former ABC legal drama starring Nicholas Pinnock.

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the cast of For Life, a co-production between Sony Pictures Television and ABC Signature Studios, recently extended their options with both studios as they await to see how the drama, about a man imprisoned for a crime he didn’t commit who becomes an attorney and helps overturn wrongful convictions, performs on the free streaming service."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was canceled in May by Burke’s successor, Craig Erwich, who now oversees both ABC and Hulu after Burke was promoted to run studio 20th Television. For Life was previously shopped to Hulu, which had SVOD rights and served as the show’s next-day streaming home. Hulu passed on renewing For Life as an original for its third season and lead studio Sony TV continued to shop the show.</p><p>IMDb TV launched in January 2019 and has built an impressive roster of library content as it looks to compete with similar free and ad-supported streaming platforms. The service is also home to original scripted series including an upcoming Leverage update, a spinoff of Amazon’s Bosch, recently renewed Alex Rider and such newly ordered series as Clea DuVall’s Tegan and Sara-inspired entry High School and Dick Wolf’s On Call.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOn6arZZyes6Z50p6YrKeeYsGpvsSeZKKllJfBt3nLopmrmaKueqWxwKVkampjaYZ4gZJpamg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
