Immediately before the incident starts, a military chopper operated by an NPC flies in from the shore. In the next several minutes, it flies about randomly, patrolling monuments, with the sole known and guaranteed waypoint being the Airfield.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Aside from that, how much ammunition does it take to take down a helicopter rust?</h3><p>**Tip: Drag a single item, such as a rifle or hatchet, to a stack of 250 ammunition so that you may take the full stack instead of having to break it up many times. Wait for all of the flames to be extinguished, and then a few minutes later, all of the heli components will become a pick axe job; strike each metal item to get even more resources.</p><p></p><h3>As a result, how often do helicopters appear in the game jailbreak?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Helicopters appear at random intervals throughout the game, respawning every 5-8 minutes.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the amount of HP Heli has rust?</h3><p>Helicopter Patrol Helicopters are equipped with two rotor blades, one for the main blades and another for the tail. If both are destroyed, the Patrol Helicopter will be destroyed as well, regardless of how much HP it had left when it was destroyed.</p><p>Helicopter on patrol.</p><p>HP 10000</p><p>HP 900 for the main rotor</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>HP 500 for the tail rotor</p><p></p><h3>There were 16 related questions and answers found.</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><h3>In Rust, where can I locate a Minicopter to fly about in?</h3><p>The Minicopter is a miniature helicopter constructed entirely of salvaged materials.
