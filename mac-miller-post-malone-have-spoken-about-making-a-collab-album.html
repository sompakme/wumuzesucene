Mac Miller may have only dropped&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Swimming</a>&nbsp;today but he's already looking far into the future at how he can continue&nbsp;his run. The Pittsburgh artist has more of a laidback approach to music and he tends to spend a lot of his time in the studio when working on his albums. This time around was no different as his name continued to be brought up after his very public break-up with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ariana Grande</a>, which he refused to speak on for the most part. During his new interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Rolling Stone</a>, the rapper speaks on the process of creating his new album and what we can expect next from him, with the idea of an album with Posty being thrown out.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The duo&nbsp;has collaborated in limited fashion in the past, featuring on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Drama</a>'s "Cameras" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, but they may be looking to make an entire project together. Miller says that a recent jam session with Post Malone, Thundercat and Frank Dukes had him thinking about the possibility of hitting us with a joint album at some point in the future. He said, "Me and Post have been talking about doing an album so we got together. And then Frank Dukes has worked on a bunch of my records, but we had never met, so he came through too. And then Thundercat appeared and we all started jamming."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Apparently, Posty was playing the bongos during their impromptu meet-up. Hopefully, this actually comes to fruition as the combination of their sounds would be pretty remarkable.
