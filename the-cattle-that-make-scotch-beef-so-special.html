They are all well-adapted to local conditions, economically and environmentally efficient and, most importantly, renowned for producing delicious, high-quality beef.</p><p>But there’s one important point to remember: always make sure the beef you’re buying is from Scotland by looking for the Scotch Beef PGI logo.&nbsp;</p><p>A remarkable three quarters of Scotland’s land mass is used for agricultural production and a large part of that is idyllic beef farming country.</p><p>In 1996, Scotch Beef became the first red meat in Europe to be awarded a respected PGI or Protected Geographical Indication. To qualify, beef farmers must adhere to a strict code of sustainable farming practices and it is in this important regard that Scotch Beef differs from, and is superior to, generic Scottish beef that has no such PGI.</p><p>The system of Scotch Beef farming is as nature intended, with small traditional herds, grazing and foraging in open pastures and suckling their young.</p><p>In stark contrast to intensive cattle farming, the system prioritises animal welfare and well-being. It is also environmentally sustainable; because there is high rainfall and grazing land is often unsuitable for growing alternative foods, there is no diversion of scarce resources from other uses. &nbsp;</p><p>Traditional native breeds of cattle in Scotland are special and distinctive for a number of reasons, not least that they are perfectly adapted to the local climate and thrive year-round. Sometimes the cattle are brought into warm sheds in winter, where they are provided with food, water and clean bedding.</p><p>For centuries, livestock farming here has contributed to biodiversity and played an important part in shaping and maintaining the unique landscape, even in regenerating native plants such as heather, for which Scotland is known and loved the world over.</p><p>For the consumer, Scotch Beef also comes with the reassurance of fabulous quality and taste. Not surprisingly, according to Stuart Ashworth, head of economics services at Quality Meat Scotland (QMS), “native breeds continue to gain in importance” and now account for nearly a quarter of the herd.</p><p>Here is a brief introduction to the four traditional beef cattle breeds of Scotland.</p><h3>Highland</h3><p>With long, flowing hair and majestic, sweeping horns, Highland Cattle is a distinctive and hardy native Scottish breed dating back to the 18th century. Indifferent to extreme weather, the cows’ natural habitat is mountain land with high rainfall, where surely no other cattle breed could exist.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Part of the landscape: the world-famous Highland</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><p>They thrive on forage and calve outside in all weathers. Many herds have been in the same family for generations and make a real economic contribution to remote hill and upland communities.</p><p><b>Why it’s famous: </b>While a lot of Scotch Beef is produced from cross breeds, pure Highland beef commands a premium price due to its fine texture, succulent flavour and healthy characteristics. Because it is slow-maturing, it produces beef that is lean but well-marbled with low cholesterol levels, yet rich in protein and flavour.</p><h3>Galloway</h3><p>Galloways too are a hardy breed that originated on the exposed uplands of Dumfries and Galloway in the south west of Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. The rarer Belted Galloway with its distinctive white stripe encircling its middle came into being from the 17th century.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Hardy: the Belted Galloway</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>Galloways are naturally polled and generally well suited to rough grazing land. They have an outer layer of long hair to shed the rain and a soft undercoat for warmth, eliminating the need for winter shelter.</p><p><b>Why it’s famous: </b>The beef from this breed is usually very marbled and therefore tastes especially succulent.</p><h3>Shorthorn</h3><p>Records of the Shorthorn date from the 18th century. During the 19th century two distinct strains of cattle were bred; one mainly for milk and the other for beef. Many of these beef Shorthorn herds were developed in Scotland.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Robust: a Shorthorn herd</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: The Scotch Kitchen</span></figure><p>It is a medium to large breed with a robust bone structure. Its coat is either deep red, white or roan (a mixture of the two). Like other native Scottish breeds it tolerates winter conditions very well and is an efficient feeder with excellent foraging ability.</p><p><b>Why it’s famous:</b> Crucially for the customer, the Shorthorn produces beef with considerable intramuscular fat (marbling) which is a key contributor to its great taste.</p><h3>Aberdeen Angus</h3><p>Aberdeen Angus is one of the most famous beef breeds of all and was developed in the 19th century in the county of Forfarshire, now known as Angus.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Easy to manage: Aberdeen Angus</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>The cattle are easily managed which is increasingly important in an era where farm labourer numbers are in decline. The breed is medium-sized (280kg – 320kg) with an all-black coat, and naturally polled (hornless). This feature facilitates calving and suckling, and later on helps the cows forage more efficiently.</p><p><b>Why it’s famous: </b>The beef sourced from these cows is famously firm yet tender, lean and juicy. In Scotland, Aberdeen Angus bulls are widely crossed with other cattle breeds, producing a nice marbled meat, full of flavour.</p><h5>Scotch Beef – always a cut above</h5><p>Only beef sourced from selected Scottish farms that adopt the best practice in animal welfare can be called Scotch Beef PGI.
