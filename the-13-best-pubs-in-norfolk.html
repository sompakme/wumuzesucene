They also make excellent venues for sampling the increasingly large range of craft beers made in small breweries from the region’s high-quality barley. These comfy, old village inns have made an impact on the gastronomic map of the region too, serving good food in welcoming surroundings and often providing a high standard of accommodation as well. Some pubs also feature live music, open mic or quiz nights, but note that the cut-off for food orders may be 8pm and on quiet evenings, bars sometimes close earlier than advertised.</p><p>For further inspiration, visit our&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to Norfolk</a>&nbsp;and discover the best&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restaurants</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hotels</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beaches</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things to do</a> in the area.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Golden Fleece</h2><p><br>Overlooking the quay, moored boats and tidal creek in the lively seaside town of Wells-next-the-Sea, this well-located, family-friendly&nbsp;pub and wine bar&nbsp;has an open-plan interior with wood floors and scrubbed-wood tables and is painted in coastal colours. The outdoor tables at the front are a good vantage point for watching the world go by on a summer’s evening. There’s more outside seating to the side of the building.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">goldenfleecewells.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:</b>&nbsp;££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Golden Fleece is a family-friendly pub and wine bar in Wells-next-the-Sea</span></figure><p><br>On the coast road and within walking distance of the quayside in the small coastal village of Burnham Overy Staithe, its name refers to Norfolk’s homegrown 18th-century naval hero, Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was born and raised close by. This foody pub serves delicious staples (burgers, steaks, pies and wherry-battered fish and chips) plus tasty desserts (crumble, cake and Norfolk ice cream), and also offers a short but tempting cocktail list. It also has three ensuite rooms in a detached building nearby.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>theheroburnhamovery.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Globe Inn</h2><p><br>In the centre of Wells-next-the-Sea,&nbsp;The Globe&nbsp;is situated on the eastern edge of the Buttlands, a broad grassy square of Georgian houses. The outside tables overlooking the green make a good place to while away a warm evening with friends and family while children play on the grass. Interiors are welcoming too and there’s a full menu if you get peckish.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>theglobeatwells.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices: </b>££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Globe Inn's outside tables overlook the green in the centre of Wells-next-the-Sea</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Hoste Arms</h2><p><br>This grande dame of North Norfolk is a popular meeting point for locals and holidaymakers, as well as being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a busy hotel</a>. Occupying a prime spot in the pretty Georgian town of Burnham Market, its front bar, with large open fireplace and heavy beams dating back some 400 years, is an atmospheric retreat on chilly evenings. In summer, the outside tables attract plenty of convivial drinkers. There's also a small cinema as well as regular musical events&nbsp;throughout the year.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thehoste.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Hoste Arms occupies a prime spot in the pretty Georgian town of Burnham Market</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Three Horseshoes</h2><p><br>Norfolk has few pubs left with serving hatches (formerly a traditional feature in this county) but one example is <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Three Horseshoes</a>, which dates back to 1725. This flint- and brick-built building with six smart guest rooms, also has pamment-tiled floors, a snug bar and a walled garden. Pies are a speciality here and are served daily except Sunday. Expect steak and ale, beef and Binham or wild mushroom, walnut and stout. Pub classics, burgers and battered fish, are also available plus reasonably priced filled rolls.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>warhamhorseshoes.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Wiveton Bell</h2><p><br>Although there’s a big emphasis on food here, some tables are reserved for non-diners&nbsp; - and there’s plenty of outside tables at the front of the pub, on wooden decking with views of Wiveton’s pretty flint-built, medieval church. That said, the menu is tempting and a step above standard pub fare so you may find yourself tempted into sampling the Cromer crab salad or the roasted tomato risotto. Sunday roasts are a speciality. There are six smartly-presented rooms if you want to make a night of it.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Contact:&nbsp;</b><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wivetonbell.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:</b>&nbsp;££</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Lifeboat Inn</h2><p><br>One of the most&nbsp;atmospheric pubs&nbsp;along the Norfolk coast, this sixteenth-century building is tucked down a backroad in the small village of Thornham. Once said to be a smugglers’ inn, it’s easy to imagine a shady character or two slipping into the dark-cornered, oak-beamed bar in days gone by. Look out for the traditional “pitch-penny” slot in one of the bar benches and try to guess the use of the farm implements that hang on the walls.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>lifeboatinnthornham.com</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Lifeboat Inn sits tucked away down a backroad in the small village of Thornham</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Jolly Sailors</h2><p><br>Real ales are a key feature of this characterful, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>eighteenth-century inn</a>, which has long been the local’s favourite in Brancaster Staithe. Have a taste of “Sharpie K12”, “Oyster Catcher” or “The Wreck” produced at its own brewery using locally grown Maris Otter barley. There’s also an excellent selection of rum and a pizza oven with ice cream served from a garden beach hut. The pub offers quiz nights and regular craft beer and music festivals.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>jollysailorsbrancaster.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices: </b>£</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Rose and Crown</h2><p><br>Close your eyes and think of a quintessential village pub. It will probably look something very like this. With its white-washed facade and roses around the door, this&nbsp;idyllic building&nbsp;offers beamed snugs, log fires and masses of character. Tucked into the village of Snettisham, it’s where the local cricket team comes for post-match refreshments, with ales including Adnams, Woodforde’s Wherry and London Pride. There’s also a garden with a pirate ship climbing frame.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>roseandcrownsnettisham.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices: </b>££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Rose and Crown is the quintessential village pub, with masses of character</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Dun Cow</h2><p><br>Situated on the A149 road in the small village of Salthouse, a few miles east of Blakeney, the&nbsp;Dun Cow&nbsp;overlooks a stretch of North Norfolk’s most beautiful marshland and reed bed coastline. When the weather is good, the large, walled garden is perfect for relaxed drinks and, inside, the exposed flint and brick walls hung with nautical prints make this pub an atmospheric retreat on a blustery evening too.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">salthouseduncow.com</a><br><b>Prices:&nbsp;</b>££</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Kings Head</h2><p><br>Near the Georgian market town of Holt, The Kings Head lies just off the A148 by a working water mill in the village of Letheringsett. Its enclosed garden and play area offers a relaxed space for families to enjoy an early evening drink on a summer’s evening and, on chillier days, there’s plenty of characterful, fire-warmed drinking space inside as well. The pub restaurant serves à la carte dishes plus a reasonably-priced two- or three-course set menu and there are four bedrooms for those who want an overnight stay.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>kingsheadnorfolk.co.uk</a><br><b>Price:</b> ££</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Hunworth Bell</h2><p><br>Locally known as the Hunny Bell, this <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>village pub</a> is in a pretty rural hamlet, two miles from the Georgian shopping town of Holt. With a cosy, fire-warmed bar and roomy dining areas, it's a good place to sample local brews supplied by the nearby Norfolk Brewhouse and Yetman’s Brewery, and gins distilled in Norwich. Chef Ben Handley runs the pub with his wife Sarah, so the focus is also on food with regularly changing menus based on British classics.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>hunworthbell.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:</b> ££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Hunworth Bell, with its cosy, fire-warmed bar, is a good place to sample local brews The Walpole Arms</span></figure><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>The Walpole Arms</h2><p><br>This red-brick eighteenth-century <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href=#>hostelry</a> lies four miles from the inland market town of Aylsham and close to the Blickling estate in a peaceful, leafy countryside. It has a traditional bar area with heavy, oak beams and wood-burner, a spacious garden room and an outside, vine-covered terrace and large garden with tables for warmer evenings.&nbsp;There’s a seasonal menu and real ales include Woodfordes Wherry and Adnams Southwold.</p><p><b>Contact:</b>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thewalpolearms.co.uk</a><br><b>Prices:&nbsp;</b>££</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Eighteenth-century hostelry, the Walpole Arms, lies four miles from the market town of Aylsham</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6dnKysmaOutbXOp6ponaWnvLGxjq6loqyVmXqstc2gm6ilX5q7qLjAp5tonZGowW6tzaCjoplfo7yzss6lomiZoqm2pLjErGanp6KbvK23jKmsm6tf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
