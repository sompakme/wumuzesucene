Juliet's storyline follows her happy marriage to Peter, only to discover his best friend is deeply in love with her, while Sam has to deal with falling in love with a girl from school, and learns the drums in order to impress her. But the mind-blowing thing about the pair is that Keira was born in 1985 and Thomas in 1990, meaning that there was only a five-year age gap between the pair. Technically Keira and Thomas could have even gone to senior school at the same time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c6e97425264d-keira-love-actually-juliet-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ew5eo5M8XRPt data-wc=7><strong>Keira was 17 when she was cast</strong></p><p id=eucBMG3RswUc data-wc=130>Keria was just 17 when she was cast in the role, and plays a character who seems older than her actual age, while Thomas was just 13, and aged down to appear as though he<a class=hm-link href=#> could still attend primary school. </a>Following the revelation, fans of the film have discussed the age gap on Twitter, with one person writing: "Still shook by the fact that Keira Knightly was only 18 when she was in Love Actually and only five years older than the guy who played the little loved-up boy wtf," while another added: "So uhhh he was 13 and looked eight and she was 18 and looked 25... interesting." A third person joked: "I can't believe Keira Knightley was 18 when she was in Love Actually???? I'm 18 and I look like a toe from hell."</p><p id=ezzfgYsuinYC><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:Andrew Lincoln thinks his Love Actually character Mark is a 'creepy stalker'</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7cf0a71de58-sam-love-actually-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=es7xeHaBPC6s data-wc=6><strong>Thomas was 13 during the filming</strong></p><p id=eDbBbujLYSub data-wc=60>Thomas, who has gone on to star in and has previously opened up about shaking off his role in Love Actually, and told the : "It's always like, 'Look what the cute little kid is up to now!'
