Her party had a princess theme and her parents got her jewels befitting a royal; Offset gifted her a Richard Mille watch that set him back $250,000, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>BuzzFeed</a>. Cardi B's present was another Eliantte piece: a diamond necklace adorned with charms including a Minnie Mouse head and a Birkin handbag. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> spoke to an expert who estimated its value to be as much as $150,000.</p><p>Kulture often models her designer clothing and purses on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page, including the Louis Vuitton backpack she received from Cardi B's "WAP" collaborator Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. Per <a href=#>BET</a>, it retailed for almost $2,000. Weeks earlier, her dad had presented her with a Birkin bag worth around $8,000, according to <a href=#>USA Today</a>. But Cardi B outdid Offset the following year when she contacted Privé Porter CEO Michelle Berk about customizing a Hermès Birkin bag for her daughter's third birthday, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>. The $38,000 accessory features a rainbow design created from Swarovski crystals and was inspired by a purse that Kulture had spotted at Claire's.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlbX9zg46cmKucmWKvbrvFn6qerF2gtqW%2FjKWYr6GjnXqttdWeqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
