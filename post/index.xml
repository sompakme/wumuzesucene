Answer
On average, you can anticipate a 50cc scooter to last anywhere between 20,000 and 30,000 kilometres on a single charge.
The same may be said about the lifespan of scooter engines. An air-cooled 50cc scooter‚Äôs usable engine life before it has to be rebuilt is probably not much more than ten thousand kilometres. If properly maintained, a water-cooled scooter such as the Vespa GTS/ or 300 series should live for 50,000 miles or more in most cases.</description></item><item><title>Marla Tellez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</title><link>/marla-tellez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/marla-tellez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html</guid><description>Marla Tellez is a Los Angeles, California-based news anchor for KTTV-TV.
