In each Catan game, earning the title of Harbormaster is yet another chance to rack up the win points. It merely adds a new special card, known as the “Harbormaster,” to the existing special cards for the Longest Road and Largest Army. It is played in a similar manner to the previous game. A simple game, for example, requires 11 victory points in order to be victorious."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Consider constructing a structure at one of the trading ports on the outside of the board.

Catan: Explorers and Pirates is the second game. Catan: Cities and Knights is the first game in the series.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Catan a simple game to learn?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>CATAN features well-established game rules that are simple to learn.
