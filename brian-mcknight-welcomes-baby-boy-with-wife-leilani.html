Today was supposed to be Kekoa’s due date, and I know how hard him not being here in the flesh with us is weighing incredibly heavy on us, but I know he is with us just like Julia and Jack are , as shining examples of your exceptional motherhood."</p><p>McKnight and Mendoza began dating back in 2014. They announced their engagement three years later in May 2017.</p><p>Check out Brian McKnight and Leilani Malia Mendoza's announcement on Instagram below.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ4F2g5RmmauhkaN6rq%2FKp6CgoKRixKa4wqiknqtdl66jxYybprJlp57BqXnWop2eZZyatq2tzaI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
