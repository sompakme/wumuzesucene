Excitement, anticipation, and then, BAM! Coy Wire is in the anchor’s seat instead of our beloved Carl Azuz. No warning, no explanation—just a switcheroo. CNN dropped a vague statement, thanking Carl for his years of service but leaving us all scratching our heads.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Naturally, the internet went into detective mode.

Twitter was abuzz with the news of Carl Azuz’s alleged demise.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Carl Azuz Now?</strong></h3><p>Now, hold your horses because Carl is very much alive! Despite the rumors, he’s kicking and breathing. The twist? He’s been trending as “dead” on Twitter. Fans are understandably concerned, given his abrupt departure from CNN 10, a show that became a daily ritual for many.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>What do we know about Carl’s life outside the newsroom? | Well, not much.

He’s not just a news anchor; he’s spoken at events nationwide, from graduations to charity functions. So, while the man might be keeping a low profile, his impact is felt far and wide.</p><h3><strong>Is Carl Azuz Dead?</strong></h3><p>Now, let’s debunk the wild rumors. It’s become a trend to prematurely announce someone’s death on social media, and Carl Azuz isn’t the first to fall victim to this digital drama. Remember the #RIPDrake saga? People thought the musician Drake had left the building, but he was very much alive.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>And then there’s the bizarre case of Queen Elizabeth’s “early demise” in February 2022, as reported by Hollywood Unlocked. Turns out, she lived until September 8, 202So, the skepticism around Carl Azuz’s alleged death isn’t unprecedented.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Carl has been the target of such rumors. In April 1, someone thought it was funny to spread the news that he had met his end in his Georgia home. The man himself had to step in, tweeting, “A great reason to examine your sources.” So, folks, let’s not jump to conclusions.</p><h3><strong>Is Carl Azuz Coming Back To CNN10?</strong></h3><p>The burning question on everyone’s mind: Is Carl Azuz making a comeback to CNN 10? | Well, on September 12, 2022, he was replaced by Coy Wire, and as of now, there’s no official statement from the network about his departure. However, it seems Carl chose to bid farewell on his terms.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>CNN expressed gratitude for his years of service and wished him the best in his future endeavors. But here’s the silver lining—Carl continues to teach the world about global events through CNN10, a 10-minute digital news program. Not only that, but he’s still contributing to CNN’s newsroom, so it looks like he’s not saying goodbye to the news world just yet.</p><p>In conclusion, folks, Carl Azuz is alive and well, and the rumors of his death are greatly exaggerated. While he may have stepped down from CNN 10, his legacy lives on. So, let’s keep our ears open for any updates and continue enjoying the engaging and factual news that Carl has brought us over the years. Until then, stay curious, stay informed, and let’s keep the conversation going.
