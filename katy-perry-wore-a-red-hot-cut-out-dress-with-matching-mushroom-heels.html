For the occasion, the pop star sported a bright red, midriff-baring Cult Gaia cutout maxi dress held together by a small knot at her waist. Puffed long sleeves and the frock's top section attached to the skin-tight dress via a circular gold ring, which also served as the dress's unconventional neckline.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Simon/startraksphoto.com/Cover Image</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the red-hot number was certainly show-stopping, the most interesting part of Perry's outfit had to be her matching pumps that featured several PVC straps and a white and red mushroom heel. The singer finished the look with simple earrings and a swipe of red lipstick, and she wore her hair in an effortless updo with face-framing pieces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>talking with InStyle</a> earlier this summer, the star touched on how her style changes when she's on and off stage. "I think that I'm two different people," Katy shared. "In my show, it's very larger-than-life. It's very 3-D. It's very over-animated. In my day-to-day and in my other business ventures, I'm a little bit more neutral, streamlined. Every once in a while, a pop of color, for instance. But it's just one color, and we stick with it. And it's a brown, neutral shades on my face."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "I would say that in my personal life, it's becoming a little bit more sophisticated and less kooky. I save the kook for the stage. But it's still an elevated kook. There's no messiness to any of it. It's intentional camp."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qaq7JloJq%2Fs8WOpJitsV2lsrO%2B2GapnpxdmMK1ec6uq2acoprAtHnMrqqhqp%2Bkum60xJ6jrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
