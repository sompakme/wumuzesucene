When combined with the universal language of love, lyrics can capture the motions of a relationship from start to finish. They include <a href=#>touching love messages</a> that listeners can use on their loved ones. These are the best lyrics in Nigeria that talk about love, relationships and heartbreak.</p><h3><i>Rock</i> - Olamide</h3><p class=align-left><i>Rock</i> by <a href=#>Olamide</a> illustrates a typical ‘boy meets girl’ scenario as the guy tries to pursue the woman he desires. “<i>Girl I just want make we rock</i>”, he sings as he declares his intentions to her.

According to the <a href=#>singer Oxlade</a>, <i>Ku lo sa</i> means 'closer'.</p><p class=align-left>Long-distance relationships can be tough, and Oxlade shares the struggle with his listeners in these relatable lyrics.

In the song, he shares how apprehensive he is of his interactions with women. He requests her phone, wary of becoming the next topic of gossip.

Make them no go see me for blog.”</i></p><h3><i>Insecure </i>- Chike</h3><p class=align-left>In the song's first verse, the singer takes us through a roller coaster of emotions from the perspective of an insecure partner. He expresses the pain of seeing his loved one shower someone else with the same love and attention that used to be reserved for him.

Some of these Nigerian artists have managed to use humour to capture the attention of their fans. These are some funny Nigerian lyrics that have left fans confused.</p><h3><i>Lady </i>- Rema</h3><p class=align-left><i>“Amaka body sweet pass hot eba”</i></p><p class=align-left>The lines are funny because nobody would typically describe eba as “sweet'', especially hot and without an accompaniment like soup. While he’s understandably trying to compliment his lady, his chosen comparison fails.</p><h3><i>Gift</i> - Iyanya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6fcf4dea70acfa02.png><p class=align-left><i>“From the couch to the bed, from the bed to the bedroom”</i></p><p class=align-left>These lyrics make fans wonder how Iyanya’s house was designed. How can he go from the bed to the bedroom? Is his bed in the kitchen?</p><h3><i>Wash</i> - Tekno</h3><p class=align-left>Trying to understand what Tekno means in these lyrics will leave you nothing short of confused. If she wants to learn karate, why would he volunteer to teach her mathematics instead? The lessons would be useless to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7efdb667a96f4c32.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Asa – Good Thing: this song will captivate your heart!</span></p></a><p class=align-left><i>“If you like karate, I will teach you mathematics”</i></p><h3><i>M.O.N.E.Y</i> - Timaya</h3><p class=align-left>Musicians are known to brag about their wealth, but Timaya takes it to the next level in this song. Not only is the lyric impractical, it is also ridiculous to picture him booking a flight to America just because his phone's battery is low.</p><p class=align-left><i>"I travel to America just to go charge my phone"</i></p><h3><i>Hakuna Matata</i> - Kaycee</h3><p class=align-left><i>"I be monkey you be banana, I will give anything that you wanna"</i></p><p class=align-left>This analogy just doesn't make sense, and it's hard to imagine what Kaycee meant. Why would he be giving a banana everything that it wants?</p><p class=align-left>Above are some of the best Nigerian lyrics of all time. From love songs to songs about annoying friends and acquaintances, they are relatable to the average audience. Fans can draw inspiration from these powerful words to help navigate different situations in life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c7ef7333ec280396.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rema - Dumebi latest hit song takes the internet by storm</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Who is the best singer in the world? 10 contenders for the title</a></p><p class=align-left>Legit.ng recently published an article on the <a href=#>best singers in the world</a>.
