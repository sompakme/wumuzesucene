The features included on his most popular mixtape <strong>Mac & Cheese 3</strong> were from some of the most prominent rappers in the game, leading some to feel that it had the potential to be an album record. Regardless, the tape fared well and its most popular track, “Ocho Cinco” (featuring Los, MGK, Diddy and Red Café) was spun constantly by club DJs, adding to its success and French’s mainstream rise as a whole.</p><p><h2>2 Chainz feat. Kanye West “Birthday Song” (2012)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the leaders of mainstream trap music, 2 Chainz debut album <strong>Based on a T.R.U. Story</strong> hardly seemed like it was the talented rapper's debut. The execution of each track and achievement of its singles made it appear as if the Southern-bred rapper had been at the top of mainstream hip-hop for years. The second single from the album, “Birthday Song”, was far from the generic birthday song sung around the world, in fact it was the complete opposite. Featuring Kanye West the song easily became the turn up, club banger of the summer of 2012. The music video that followed just brought everything to the next level.</p><p><h2>Kanye West, Big Sean and Pusha T feat. 2 Chainz “Mercy” (2012)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Cruel Summer</strong>, released in the fall of 2012, was a collaborative album featuring the majority of G.O.O.D Music’s artists as well as other A-List hip-hop affiliates. The album's first single released earlier that year, “Mercy” featured West along with Big Sean, Pusha T and 2 Chainz. The rappers combined talents equaled up to a banger that received an immense amount of airplay and sold millions of copies.</p><p><h2>Ace Hood feat.

Released at the beginning of last year, “Bugatti” eventually went platinum, selling a million copies. The single never reached number one on the charts but that did not inhibit its success and it was nominated Track of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards.</p><p><h2>Drake “Started From the Bottom” (2013)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although released over a year ago, this hit from Drizzy Drake remains a banger in the club. The first single from the Young Money rapper's widely successful third album, <strong>Nothing Was the Same</strong>, “Started From the Bottom” chronicles Drake’s rise from small-time actor to hip-hop superstar over the course of several years. The single charted worldwide, reaching its peak at number two in the U.S. in addition to being nominated for two Grammy Awards and beating out Ace Hood for Track of the Year at the BET Hip Hop Awards in 2013.</p><p><h2>French Montana feat.

Game, Kendrick Lamar and Dr. Dre all hail from the inner city just South of Downtown Los Angeles and represent their city in the best ways. The most recent talent “straight outta Compton” is rapper YG. In a matter of what feels like only months the twenty four-year old rapper has made his way to the very top of music industry success. The leading single from his new album <strong>My Krazy Life</strong>, “My Hitta” (originally titled “My Ni**a”) is largely to thank for the rapper's overnight celebrity. Featuring Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan, the record has been described by various media outlets as one of the best songs of 2013, selling well over a million copies.</p><h2><a href=# class=text-word>Migos</a> feat. Drake "Versace Remix" (2013)</h2><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The remix of this track, similar to the "Don't Like (Remix)" from Kanye West, garnered the track a ton of buzz. It was mainly thanks to Drake's verse, but nonetheless it put Migos on the map and was basically their break-through. Migos' catchy hook didn't hurt the track's popularity. It also resulted in a bunch of copy cats of Migos' staccato flow.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>French Montana “Aint Worried About Nothin” (2013)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">French Montana pops up on this list once again. He has been consistent with the club hits since the release of his 2012 mixtape <strong>Mac & Cheese 3</strong>. His debut, <strong>Excuse My French</strong> proved that the rapper has a true gift when it comes to creating the perfect music to turn up to. Arguably more popular with fans than the first single from<strong> Excuse My French</strong> “Pop That”, as well as the second “Freaks”, “Aint Worried About Nothin” catapulted Montana to the top of hip-hop even though it was not a commercial success in the sense of numbers. Sometimes success can be measured in how many people turn up to your music, and French has shown that to be true.</p><p><h2>Drake "Worst Behavior" (2013)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to "Started From The Bottom", Drizzy Drake had another successful banger on his hand with "Worst Behavior", both tracks appeared on the latest album from the Toronto native, <strong>Nothing Was The Same</strong>. This cut still has everyone screaming, "mufuckas never loved us" plus "WORST!" whenever the record plays (and even when it's not playing). The track's transition gets you even more hype.</p><p><h2>Young Dro “FDB” (2013)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following his first album<strong> Best Thang Smokin’</strong> and its triumph with the track “Shoulder Lean”, Grand Hustle rapper Young Dro went on somewhat of a hiatus and did not release another solo studio album for several years. The break from mainstream music did not deter the rapper from coming back with a vengeance though. In late 2013 he released his second studio album <strong>High Times</strong> which featured the popular single “FDB.” The single became Dro’s second highest charting song since his 2006 single “Shoulder Lean” falling just under the track at number two on the charts.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Future feat.

Debuting on the charts at number two it is the prime example of the term, “the charts don’t lie.” Featuring a mélange of talented guests, one of the most popular tracks on the album is, “Move That Dope” featuring Pharrell Williams, Pusha T and Casino. With an upbeat tempo that would make almost anyone want to dance the song has also been a success in that it is the “highest charting single” from the rapper to date. Future never disappoints when it comes to bangers that you’re praying the DJ will play on a night out and dancing and rapping along to when he does, because obviously he will.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Lil Jon and DJ Snake feat. Juicy J, 2 Chainz and French Montana “Turn Down For What (Remix)” (2014)</h2></p><p>Top Hip-Hop Club Bangers Of The Past Decade</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With the popularity of EDM becoming ever-increasing in the mainstream it is no surprise to see more and more hip hop artists collaborating with the top electronic artists. The most recent hip-hop/EDM track that has gained immense popularity is Lil Jon and DJ Snakes “Turn Down For What (Remix)” featuring Juicy J, 2 Chainz and French Montana. The remix irrefutably crossed the high energy party song even more into the genre of hip hop and is the perfect combination of both sounds. A true crowd pleaser the single is a prime example of what’s in store for the future of music.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Sage The Gemini feat.

The record contains the hyphy, upbeat sounds you might expect from a Bay Area rapper, which in turn, makes it the perfect club banger. The low-key hook makes you even more excited for when the record picks up pace, and we have a feeling this'll be blasting in the club for the rest of the summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZn50fYytpqllmJ69brTOqWScpKWXeqOtzaCcq6tdpLNuwMeeZKmZo6l6pbHCmpueZZ6axLQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
