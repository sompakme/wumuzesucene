Reviews</p><p>"I'm a Colleen Hoover fan girl at this point, and I've got quite the collection. I first read 'It Ends With Us', and absolutely loved it. I'm counting down the days to watch the movie starring Blake Lively later this summer. BookTok is obsessed with <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow">'Verity'</a> and I enjoyed that one but it's not in my top 3 Colleen Hoover books. My recent fave has to be 'Ugly Love'. <a href=#><strong>Leanne Bayley, Director of Lifestyle & Commerce</strong></a><br></p><p>Colleen Hoover provides readers with hit after hit, and 'Ugly Love' is a clear winner on TikTok. The novel centres around Tate Collins meeting airline pilot Miles Archer. Forget love at first sight, this is attraction at first sight! The pair embark on a no-strings-attached arrangement but as you might expect, things get a little messy.</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J.

The fantasy series has gained a cult following, and has been described by author Alexandra Bracken as, "a gorgeously written tale as lush and romantic as it is ferocious."<br></p><h2>Romance Books</h2><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Maybe In Another Life by Taylor Jenkins Reid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fa1b1a272892-maybe-in-another-life.png><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn>HELLO! Reviews</p><p dir=ltr>"From the author of 'The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo', Taylor Jenkins Reid writes a captivating Sliding Doors-style novel that will have you hooked from start to finish. I loved the style of alternating chapters that play out the results of Hannah's small decision, and I couldn't wait to find out what happened next." <a href=#><strong>Sophie Bates, Commerce Writer</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The book follows two storylines of Hannah Martin, following the meeting of an old flame. In alternating chapters we see the two stories unfold with different outfits and large-scale consequences for Hannah and those around her, raising the question of whether anything is truly meant to be, and whether there is really such thing as a soul mate.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Same Time Next Summer by Annabel Monaghan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/577d88363a2d-same-time-next-summer-book.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn>HELLO! Reviews</p><p dir=ltr>"Someone on Amazon described this book as 'Delicious, like a bag of chips you can't put down until it's finished' and I have to agree. This isn't full on, and sexy as other books you can buy in the romance category, but it's definitely sweet and easy, and light, with all the magic of first love. It gave me all the feels - similar to when I watched 'The Summer I Turned Pretty', the Amazon Prime hit based on the book by Jenny Han. It's almost a little bit Hallmark (but I say that in a good way). <a href=#><strong>Leanne Bayley, Director of Lifestyle & Commerce</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The story centres around Sam, who has the perfect life; she has a great job, the perfect fiancé, and a home she loves in the busy city. But when she returns home to her family's Long Island beach house to discuss wedding planning, she bumps into her first love, Wyatt. He's the man who broke her heart. As they spend more time together, the spark comes rushing back. But what happens when she's about to say 'I do'?

Reviews</p><p>"Jojo Moyes is the author of the bittersweet 'Me Before You' - &nbsp;she also wrote the screenplay for the film starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin (yes, I ugly cried watching it) - and her short story collection is the perfect escape while on holiday or at home in your garden, too. And because it's in small doses of 11 tales – a real rollercoaster of love, humour and heartbreak about navigating the world of amour – it's perfect for any moment, no matter how brief, whether unwinding at the end of the day or relaxing in a sun lounger. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but the first, and longest, story - 'Paris for One' - the story of Nell, who goes on her romantic weekend trip to Paris alone after her terrible boyfriend bails on her last minute - had me hooked! It's a breezy read that's engaging, too." <a href=#><strong>Karen Silas, Senior Lifestyle Editor</strong></a></p><p>If you're a fan of modern romance, 'Emily in Paris' and charming short stories, you'll love 'Paris for One and Other Stories' by Jojo Moyes.

It has been hyped up on Bookstagram and BookTok, but I now know why. It's genuinely one of the BEST books I've ever read! It's one of those books that you carry on reading through the night even though you know you've got to go to sleep, it's just an addictive read. I have now read the sequel (which is called 'It Starts With Us' - you may as well buy both of them at the same time) and I cannot wait to see the movie. This is a great holiday book. It's an emotional rollercoaster - it made me laugh, it made me cry and I'm now officially in the Colleen Hoover fan club." <a href=#><strong>Leanne Bayley, Director of Lifestyle & Commerce</strong></a><br></p><p>Everyone has heard of 'It Ends With Us' by now. The number one bestseller went viral on TikTok and Instagram and is currently being made into a movie starring Blake Lively.

I absolutely adored it, although it's definitely not your typical autobiography. This is not a tell-all of his Common People days of fame and success - it ends with a 1988 acceptance letter from Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design in London, a decade before his career really took off. It's charming, funny and nostalgic in equal measures - a highly enjoyable read." <a href=#><strong>Katherine Robinson, Senior Lifestyle Editor</strong></a></p><p dir=ltr>The memoir from Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker delves into his unique life in 20th-century pop culture. It unfolds as Jarvis reviews the contents of his loft, deciding to keep or throw the objects he has stashed away there - each one with a story attached to it that reveals something pivotal about his youth and the things that shaped him and prepared him for his role as the quirky lead singer that went on to garner national treasure status.<br></p><p id=ehmIgf4rz8A></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Best hand luggage 2024: These carry-on suitcases & bags make holiday travel so much easier" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1d0f7df41fe5-best-carry-on-luggage-suitcases.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Best hand luggage 2024: These carry-on suitcases & bags make holiday travel so much easier" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Best hand luggage 2024: These carry-on suitcases & bags make holiday travel so much easier</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What you need to pack for a holiday: 90 must-have items" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2e3551ea31b3-packing-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What you need to pack for a holiday: 90 must-have items" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What you need to pack for a holiday: 90 must-have items</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="23 best toiletry travel bags for women: From pouches to vanity cases, hanging options & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f5f6fbbd8a1a-best-toiletry-bags.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="23 best toiletry travel bags for women: From pouches to vanity cases, hanging options & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>23 best toiletry travel bags for women: From pouches to vanity cases, hanging options & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
