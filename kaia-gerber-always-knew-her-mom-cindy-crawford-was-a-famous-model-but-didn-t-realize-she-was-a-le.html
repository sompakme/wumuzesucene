In an interview with<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.wsj.com/style/fashion/kaia-gerber-book-club-actress-model-interview-92288330 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>The Wall Street Journal</u></a>, Gerber admitted that her own successful modeling career was no doubt shaped because of Crawford’s, but after watching the docuseries, she finally got the full scope.</p><p>“I was like, ‘I didn’t realize,’” Gerber told the outlet. “‘I knew you were iconic, but…’ I didn’t understand when I was younger. I was starstruck in front of her after.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fy3bCWZ9n5BMXZK5RJ6PJ7-1920-80.jpeg><p>After all, to the world she’s Cindy Crawford, but to Gerber? She’s just mom. The mother-daughter duo of Crawford and Gerber are lookalikes—it’s a near copy/paste—and Gerber said watching The Super Models opened her eyes to all that Crawford had to go through to provide the life she did for their family, which also includes Gerber’s dad, Casamigos cofounder Rande Gerber, and brother, Presley Gerber.</p><p>“What she made of her career, there wasn’t really someone’s footsteps to follow,” Gerber said. “And I thought it was so cool that she always had that ambition, and she did things where people told her, ‘This will ruin your career. Don’t do this.’ And she trusted her instincts.” She further praised her mother for being so “smart and focused and ambitious” from “a very young age,” despite “coming from a very different background" than Gerber herself did.</p><p>Gerber obviously did have someone’s footsteps to follow and told The Wall Street Journal that she is well aware of her privilege and leg up into the modeling industry. “I don’t think it’s a topic that will go away, so I’ve clearly reached a point of acceptance,” she said of being a so-called nepo baby. “I personally am very aware of all the wonderful things it has done for me, and I would never, ever say anything negative about it, because that is my truth about it.”&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

She said she feels fortunate because “I can actually ask my parents [for] advice on career things, on business things,” Gerber said. “That’s very rare, to have parents who are in the same industry or career as you, whose advice you actually can trust.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGijkZ6ubrPEq5meql2ku63FjKucnJ2eqbm6edGemKWhqpqxbq%2FIp5uyZZOnrriyzqubZqulpbKzuc6dnKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
