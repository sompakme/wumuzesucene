Remember when the InGen hunters run into the long grass, even after Ajay Sidhu warns them against it? Then suddenly the raptors are aware of their presence? It’s a truly nail-biting scene! And it was filmed right in Newhall, California, at the Indian Dunes Film Ranch.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where was “Jurassic Park 3” filmed?</h3><p>A few new film locations were added to the list for the filming of “Jurassic Park 3.” New states used in the filming of the third “Jurassic Park” film included Nevada, Florida, and Utah. Quite a lot of the filming took place specifically at Universal Studios in both Florida and California.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Filming in Jordan, Montana</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/Hell_Creek_State_Park.jpg><p>While <a href=#>IMDB doesn’t include it</a> on its list of filming locations for “Jurassic Park 3,” the “Big Sky State” of Montana also makes an appearance during the filming. The Hell Creek Bar and Grill in Jordan, Montana, is featured in the movie in <a href=#>what the bar calls</a> “a nod to these real life bone diggers.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s because Jordan’s Hell Creek Formation is actually home to the 1904 discovery of a Tyrannosaurus Rex! The <a href=#>Garfield County Museum</a> in Jordan also houses a full-size Triceratops cast from one of the original fossils excavated in the Jordan area. With this in mind, it makes even more sense that Grant’s assistant, Billy Brennan, was looking for dinosaur fossils in this area in the movie.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where was “Jurassic World” filmed?</h3><p>For the filming of “Jurassic World,” the production crew found their way back to shooting quite a bit in Hawaii. The crew filmed dinosaur island in their old stomping grounds of Kualoa Ranch, as well as using a variety of other gorgeous filming locations throughout Kaua’i and O’ahu.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Filming in New Orleans, Louisiana</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>While about 50% of “Jurassic World” was filmed in Hawaii, many of the interior shots actually came from the abandoned Six Flags in New Orleans, Louisiana, and studio sets on the NASA campus. You can see how the film crews used these Louisiana locations for filming in the video above.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where was “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” filmed?</h3><p>“Jurassic Word: Fallen Kingdom” took to a whole new country for much of its filming: the United Kingdom! London, Buckinghamshire, Northumberland, Hampshire, and even Argyll, Scotland, were chosen as filming locations. In fact, the film crew even chose to use a British studio for filming indoor shots at <a href=#>Pinewood Studios</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Filming in Rothbury, England</h3><p><a href=#>According to the National Trust</a>, Cragside in Rothbury, England became the filming grounds of “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” in the winter of 2016. The Victorian countryside house plays the role of the Lockwood Manor in the film and the trust used the income from the film to contribute to the conservation of the house and its grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbHEq6qpmZOae6S7zGipnqufqr%2BksdJorqGdopp6uK3SZqGuqpGowKqvjKmYq6Ndm7atucSdZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
