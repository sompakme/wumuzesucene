Get a degree in Theology</h2><p class=align-left>The first step toward becoming a bishop is to get a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">degree in theology</a>. Theology is the study of God and his nature.</p><p class=align-left>A degree in theology often prepares you for work in Christian service. For some Christian groups, a degree in theology is a must before one could be ordained into any high office.</p><p class=align-left>There are many universities and colleges offering degrees in theology that prepare people for Christian work, such as priesthood. Some churches have their own Bible colleges that offer degrees in theology.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9c461b58a0de0d5b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 most famous Jordan Peterson quotes of all time</span></p></a><h2>2. Attend a seminary</h2><p class=align-left>Going to a seminary is one of the basic requirements for becoming a priest and a bishop.</p><p class=align-left>Although not all priests become bishops, going to a seminary is a must for those who aspire to become priests, especially in the Catholic Church.</p><p class=align-left>Many churches, such as the Assemblies of God Church, also have seminaries where their <a href=#>pastors</a> are trained before ordination. Identify a seminary attached to your church and enroll if you so want to become an ordained man of God and ultimately a bishop.</p><h2>3. Get priestly ordination</h2><p class=align-left>Attending and graduating from a Christian seminary is not enough to become a priest and, or bishop. You must also be ordained by someone with higher authority or anointing.</p><p class=align-left>Your ordination as a priest in the case of the Catholic Church is usually conducted by a bishop who is in charge of parishes.</p><p class=align-left>In the case of other denominations that have Bible colleges, the ordination is usually done by a senior pastor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49443c94193f87a8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Christian podcasts for you and your loved ones</span></p></a><h2>4. Serve as priest over a parish</h2><p class=align-left>Becoming a bishop is a long process. One must have enough experience to be appointed a bishop.</p><p class=align-left>This means you must first serve as a priest or labour for some years in a church. Since bishophood is a senior position in the church, such a person must have served for a number of years as a priest.</p><h2>5. Be ordained a bishop</h2><p class=align-left>Becoming a bishop also requires ordination since it is a higher office in the spiritual realm. Not all priests, pastors or ministers eventually become bishops, even after fulfilling other requirements.</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vatican City Tours</a>, there are age requirements to be ordained a bishop in the case of the Catholic church.</p>"Bishops are required to be 35 years old, ordained at least five years prior and hold a doctorate in theology. They are believed to truly hold expertise in canon law and sacred scripture. They typically govern over local regions known as dioceses."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d70f37e31b6bb954.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most famous Frederick Douglass quotes on education, power and slavery</span></p></a><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class=align-left>A bishop holds serious office, and it is not to be ridiculed or sold. Only qualifying persons become bishops in many Christian groups. This position often requires many years of experience and educational attainments.</p><h2>Peter Obi visits David Oyedepo</h2><p class=align-left>In a related story, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> reported that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, <a href=#>Peter Obi</a>, <a href=#>visited the senior pastor</a> of the Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo.</p><p class=align-left>The story has it that the LP flagbearer visited the popular clergy in his Cannan Land Church, Otta, <a href=#>Ogun state</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Photos shared on social media showed the two popular leaders together.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGlkbX51fZZmraKqkaF6o7XSoaapm5iWua2xzaCcZmlgYsC1sc%2BsZKehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSboaOdvLG%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
