Most recently, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she and Lil Mama got into it on social media</a>. The two had an argument about <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>NLE Choppa</a>'s new music video, in which Sukihana made an appearance. Lil Mama accused the rapper of setting black women back "centuries" because of her role in the video. The whole disagreement began when Choppa shared a photo from his "Slut Me Out" remix video shoot. It showed Sukihana and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> on all fours like dogs with Choppa leading them by the hair. Lil Mama reportedly wrote a comment under Choppa's post, which she later deleted, prompting Sukihana to express her thoughts on Twitter.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“They said the girl ‘lil mama’ that sing that lip gloss song was in the comments speaking on me. If I was y’all I would tell her leave me tf alone,” Sukihana tweeted after the incident. Lil Mama was quick to respond and let Suki know exactly why she made the comment in the first place. "I know we don’t know each other personally... You could of been any Blacc woman in that video I posted a comment under. The way I feel still stands," Lil Mama said in her reply. "I feel like women these days will know BETTER and still play a role in setting us bacc centuries. The only reason I deleted my comment was because I didn’t want to offend you and anyone else partaking in this disturbing clip." Well, Lil Mama better buckle up because Sukihana just made some even more "disturbing" comments in a new interview on The Jason Lee Show.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sukihana-channels-brenda-meeks>Sukihana Channels Brenda Meeks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a new clip from Sukihana's interview, host Jason Lee was left absolutely speechless. Referencing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Yung Miami's previous comments</a> about liking golden showers, the rapper said, "I feel like Yung Miami. I love when a n*gga p*ss on me." There was a very pronounced silence after she said this, but Sukihana made it clear that she thinks many women are just afraid to speak out about what they like. "That was real b*tch. Y’all h*s scared to talk about what the f*ck you like because you so worried about what these b*tches gone think.” Jason Lee simply stares with his mouth open in shock as the rapper speaks about her kinky streak. Unfortunately for him, Sukihana was nowhere near finished.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Baby, if you p*ss on me, make sure you get my hair done after," the rapper continued. Then, she looked directly into the camera to speak her piece. "P*ss on me. P*ss in my mouth. Let me p*ss on his mouth. Fart in your face. I wanna sh*t on top of your hair and rub it in." Some commenters on the post pointed out how Sukihana seemed to be channeling Regina Hall's Scary Movie character Brenda Meeks. In the film series, the character famously says a similar line. Whether or not the rapper meant it as a callback is unknown. One thing is for certain, she isn't holding anything back. What do you think of Sukihana's preferences? Sound off in the comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4R1fZhmqq6jmZ2ur62MpaavnaNitLC4w56lZquYpMSmvtI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
