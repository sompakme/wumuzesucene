"Retinol encourages cell turnover, helping cells to promote the emergence of new skin," she says. "This helps in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles." Regular use can lead to smoother skin, help to fade dark spots and hyperpigmentation, prevent the clogging of pores, and potentially reduce the occurrence of body acne.</p><p>"Retinol has also been shown to stimulate collagen production, improving skin elasticity and firmness." says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/brendan-camp-md referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Brendan Camp</a>, M.D. F.A.A.D and board-certified dermatologist.<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/brendan-camp-md referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u></u></a> "Retinol is also great for tightening crepiness and loose skin.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-where-to-apply-retinol-body-lotion><span>Where to Apply Retinol Body Lotion</span></h2><p>"Retinol body lotion can be beneficial for any part of the body but is particularly effective on areas that show signs of aging or damage, such as the arms, legs, and décolletage," says Dr. Shokeen. "It’s also helpful on areas with rough skin texture or keratosis pilaris, such as the legs."</p><p>Dr. Camp adds, "The chest, shoulders, and back, which have a higher concentration of sebaceous glands and are more prone to sun exposure and sun damage, may benefit most from the retinol body lotions." Retinol body lotions can also be used on the hands, which are often overlooked.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-concentration-of-retinol-should-i-use-on-my-body><span>What Concentration of Retinol Should I Use on my Body?</span></h2><p>When choosing one retinol body lotion over another, you should keep concentration and potency in mind. "Start with a lower concentration of retinol and use it every other night," Dr. Penzi suggests. Generally speaking, the product should fall between .25 and one percent.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-often-should-i-use-a-retinol-body-lotion><span>How Often Should I Use a Retinol Body Lotion?</span></h2><p>Start using a retinol body lotion twice per week. "Gradually increase the frequency as your skin tolerates it. This helps your skin adjust to the retinol and reduces the risk of irritation," says Dr. Garshick. While all skin types can benefit from retinol, those with dry or sensitive skin may want to ease into it especially slowly. In a similar vein, Dr. Shokeen and Dr. Camp say that people with rosacea, eczema, dry skin, or expecting mothers should avoid retinol or should speak with a doctor before use.</p><p>"I recommend applying at nighttime, as retinol can make your skin sensitive to sunlight, and using it during the day may increase the risk of sunburn," says Dr. Penzi.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-what-should-i-avoid-with-a-retinol-body-lotion><span>What Should I Avoid With a Retinol Body Lotion?</span></h3><p>Because retinol increases the rate of cell turnover, you should avoid using it in tandem with acids like salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as with acne-fighting ingredients like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-benzoyl-peroxide-products/>benozyl peroxide</a>. Rather, if you're looking for a retinol lotion that specifically targets acne, find one that incorporates anti-acne ingredients in delicate combinations and dosages approved by scientists and dermatologists.</p><p>You should also avoid applying retinol lotion on already fragile skin patches. Dr. Penzi, Dr. Garshick, Dr. Camp, and Dr. Shokeen all say users should avoid using retinol directly after shaving because razors create micro-abrasions on the skin and compromise the skin barrier, resulting in a temporarily hyper-sensitive environment.</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-meet-the-experts><span>Meet the Experts</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/atkFv3huT4rqLJ3TK9Zn3f-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Dr. Lauren Penzi, M.D.</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=FACEBOOK><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=INSTAGRAM><span class=button-social__icon></span></a><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board-Certified Dermatologist<p>Dr. Lauren Penzi, M.D., is a board-certified dermatologist based in New York state. &nbsp;A graduate of Loyola University Maryland and New York Medical College, she specializes in medical and cosmetic dermatology and is a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, the American Society for Laser Medicine & Surgery, and the Women’s Dermatologic Society.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t2gE2fbZaciFcYM89tpHun-1920-80.png><span class=person__name>Dr. Marisa Garshick</span><a class=button-social href=# aria-label=WEBSITE><span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"></span></a>Board Certified Dermatologist<p>Marisa Garshick, M.D., F.A.A.D is a leading board-certified dermatologist serving patients throughout Manhattan, New York at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery, as well as an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Cornell New York Presbyterian Medical Center.
