Defense lawyer's heated momentWhile cross-examining Ivanka, Suarez tried to have Ivanka elaborate on the success of their redevelopment of the Old Post Office project. She recalled receiving praise from two members of Congress, who asked her to come to a field hearing in Brooklyn about the potential redevelopment of federal assets.
Suarez then lost his cool, accusing AG office attorneys of laughing at him and mocking the contributions of the Trump family."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Those renovations, she acknowledged, cost $7.5 million, a massive figure by any measure, but especially so for a property one does not even own.</p><p>Suarez asks, “How do you feel about the work that you did for your family’s business?”</p><p>“I feel incredibly proud of the work that I did for the Trump Hotel Collection,” and the Doral and Old Post Office properties specifically, Ivanka testifies. That she did not talk more extensively&nbsp;about the Trump Org., however, and limited her pride to her redevelopment work specifically, should be noted.</p><p>109d ago / 9:06 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Judge Engoron shuts down Team Trump on document</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Team Trump desperately wanted to show Ivanka a document reflecting GSA’s impression that Mazars qualified Trump’s financial statements as non-compliant with GAAP. But there’s a key problem: The document was internal to the GSA, and there is no proof that she ever saw it.</p><p>The document doesn’t come into evidence, but over objections by the attorney&nbsp;general’s&nbsp;office, Engoron allows Ivanka to testify that she has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the GSA’s observation.</p><p>109d ago / 9:01 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Donald Trump appeals D.C. gag order as Ivanka testifies in N.Y.</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><p>The fallout from Ivanka’s testimony doesn’t thus far appear to have led her father to violate his New York gag order for a third time. But his Washington, D.C., lawyers just filed an appellate brief in the federal election interference case, challenging his other gag order there. They’re<a href=#> complaining</a> that it violates the First Amendment.</p><p>The filing brings to mind Trump lawyer Alina Habba’s<a href=#> funny comment</a> on Monday that she wouldn’t try to limit her client’s free speech in the face of his unhinged New York testimony. It also serves as a reminder that this civil fraud trial, while cutting to the heart of everything that is Donald Trump, is far from his only legal challenge ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>109d ago / 8:52 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Bank had legitimate reason for favorable loan terms, defense suggests</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Ivanka testifies to remembering that around 20 agencies were involved in the bidding process for the Old Post Office property — and she says that her family's “labor of love” to bring their vision of a luxury hotel to fruition paid off through their recent sale.</p><p>Suarez asks whether Deutsche Bank understood that vision and if the bank was excited about it. Ivanka says it was an “incredibly special and iconic” building that Rosemary Vrablic told them was “the crown jewel” in their real estate portfolio. Still, she said once the terms of the loan were negotiated, she turned her attention to the development of the asset itself, and others took over communication with Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Overall, Suarez seems to be suggesting that Deutsche Bank had legitimate reasons for lending to Trump on such favorable terms: the uniqueness of the assets, a belief in the Trump Org.’s ability to transform assets, and a desire to cement a long-term, multi-pronged relationship with a famous, high net worth family.</p><p>109d ago / 8:18 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Ivanka says father had 'sentimental' attachment to Doral project</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Suarez is trying to counter a dominant theme of today’s Ivanka testimony with one of his own: The Trump family could have self-financed the Doral project in Florida or obtained loans from any number of other financing sources.</p><p>Ivanka testifies that Doral was chosen, interestingly, because Trump had a deep "sentimental" attachment to it: He had been there with his own father as a child; he had visited its once-world-class spa with her mother, Ivanka; and she even believed he had taken her there when she was small.</p><p>Ivaka is talking at length about the renovation of the hotel and spa. "My father has a particular affinity for golf and a vision for it,” so she focused on the resort while he focused on the hotel, she says.</p><p>Show more</p><p>Suarez is trying to demonstrate that in Deutsche Bank, the Trump Org. found a true partner with a genuine interest in their projects. The bank, Ivanka says, not only visited the project during its development and understood the family’s vision for it but was “very happy” upon its completion.</p><p>Indeed, Suarez calls up a March 2013 email in which Deutsche Bank's Vrablic, following a post-renovation site visit, told Ivanka, “It is really impressive to see what you have accomplished so quickly.” Vrablic added, in a section Suarez does not read, “say hi to Jared for me.”</p><p>109d ago / 8:15 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Ivanka says she can't recall a lot — but remembers this meeting</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Ivanka, for all her lack of recall, says she does remember a meeting she attended between her father and then-Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain in 2013.</p><p>She testifies that it was an “introductory meeting” that Ivanka characterizes as “a sales call” to encourage further partnership between the Trumps and the bank. After that meeting, Jain sent Donald Trump a fawning letter that said, “It was a pleasure to see your delight in the buildout of your family holdings and your justified pride in having your children in the business.”</p><p>109d ago / 8:08 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Defense hammers at a theme: Deutsche Bank wanted tie to Trumps</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Suarez, despite Team Trump's constant complaints about documents that predate the inception of the statute of limitations, is showing Ivanka a 2012 email in which a Deutsche Bank banker invited her to a lunch to learn about investing in SoftBank.</p><p>Ivanka says she does not remember it. She also says it’s possible, although she doesn’t remember, that Deutsche Bank wanted to highlight the Trump family’s involvement through a promotional video. She is then shown a 2012 email through which Vrablic asks her to participate in such a promotional video.</p><p>Suarez is hammering at a theme: Deutsche Bank wanted to make money, and the favorable loan terms they extended to Trump were part and parcel of an overall strategy to make money from their relationship with the Trumps. Not only did the bank offer them other investment opportunities or banking services, but seemed to have believed publicity from the Trump relationship would benefit the bank.</p><p>109d ago / 8:02 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Why Donald Trump's lawyers are cross-examining Ivanka</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><p>Donald Trump wasn’t cross-examined on Monday by his lawyers, though he and his co-defendant adult sons could be called again to the stand by the defense when it presents its case after the state rests.</p><p>Ivanka, however, isn’t a defendant in the case and isn’t on the defense witness list, so that could be at least part of why the Trump side wants to question her while they have her there.</p><p>109d ago / 7:58 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Ivanka faces cross-examination from father's legal team</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Ivanka is now being cross-examined by Trump attorney Jesus Suarez, who has her reiterate that she had zero involvement in preparing or reviewing the statements of financial condition or valuing assets.</p><p>And now they are moving on to her relationship with Rosemary Vrablic, from Deutsche Bank’s private wealth management group.

Ivanka does not cast doubt on this.</p><p>Ivanka testifies that she may have had a revocable trust at some point, but is not sure it is active. Solomon then asks her whether her revocable trust ever owed her father an interest so that he could satisfy his guarantee in connection with the Old Post Office loan.</p><p>Ivanka says she does not believe so, but Solomon whips out a document with signatures from each of her, Eric and Don Jr., on behalf of their respective revocable trusts. And that document, contrary to Ivanka’s recollection, pledges to make “prompt and unconditional payment” of their defined “proportionate share” of the guarantee for the Old Post Office loan.</p><p>Show more</p><p>Ivanka says this doesn’t refresh her recollection of the document, but she doesn’t doubt the authenticity of her signature.</p><p>This is the first truly surprising moment in Ivanka’s testimony. The AG has apparently assembled proof that after making a personal guarantee to Deutsche Bank in connection with the Old Post Office loan, Trump essentially forced his kids to pay him money to ensure he could meet that obligation.</p><p>109d ago / 7:40 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Ivanka questioned about Old Post Office loan she negotiated</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>Solomon is now reviewing with Ivanka a term sheet for the Old Post Office loan, which she negotiated.

Not only did Ivanka ask for Kushner’s help in approaching other potential sources of lending, but her colleagues at the Trump Org. sent him internal drafts of presentations with a note that they planned to “remove management fees from the income statement.”</p><p>Ivanka testifies that she did not have a view as to whether that was appropriate.</p><p>109d ago / 7:20 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Judge OKs Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner email chain</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>We are back in session, and before Ivanka returns to the stand, Engoron is showing his work and ruling that Ivanka and Kushner’s email chain, which was over their respective work accounts, waived any privilege.</p><p>The judge cites a New York State case squarely on point.

Notwithstanding her failure to recall events or core deal terms, Ivanka has been cooperative, gracious and controlled.

But unlike her father, who steadfastly insisted his financial statements were largely irrelevant to the banks, despite language to the contrary in lending agreements, Ivanka seems content to let documents speak for themselves, even when the overall implications for her dad and brothers aren’t helpful.</p><p>109d ago / 6:52 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Unpacking these 'devastating series of documents'</h2><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--generic-thumbnail styles_bylineThumbnail___nR29"></span><p>Lisa Rubin explains the "devastating series of documents" discussed during the first part of Ivanka's testimony today.</p><p>109d ago / 5:56 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Court breaks for lunch until 2:15 p.m. ET</h2><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--generic-thumbnail styles_bylineThumbnail___nR29"><a href=#></a></span><p>It's been a less volatile though nonetheless illuminating day of testimony for Ivanka as compared to her father's time on the stand earlier this week.</p><p>The court is taking its lunch break and will return in roughly an hour.</p><p>109d ago / 5:51 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ever talk business?

Kushner later advised her that he could help her obtain more favorable financing from Natixis, another bank, and as state attorney Solomon asks why she was talking to Kushner about Trump Org. loan terms, Kise’s renewed objection about spousal privilege causes Engoron to call for the lunch break.</p><p>109d ago / 5:48 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Ivanka's lack of recollection appears to frustrate AG's office</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>There has been some hot back and forth between the lawyers about&nbsp;Ivanka’s&nbsp;lack of recollection of GSA’s concerns about her father’s statements of financial condition.</p><p>Seeming almost apologetic, not combative, she reiterated that she only remembers one in-person meeting and that it took place at the beginning of the process.</p><p>Solomon is visibly frustrated that Ivanka appears to remember details about construction, for example, but not about the GSA’s perception of deficiencies&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;Org. bid.</p><p>109d ago / 5:45 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Judge says Trump lawyer is 'starting to sound like' his client</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><p>While Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka is on the stand, Judge Engoron said Trump lawyer Chris Kise is “starting to sound like your client.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately for Kise, that was apparently in reference to the lawyer’s laudatory remarks about Trump-related real estate (the Old Post Office property that’s the subject of Ivanka’s testimony), rather than, say, an apparent suggestion that the lawyer was in danger of violating the gag order that Trump has been found to violate twice and<a href=#> has been extended</a> to his lawyers as well.</p><p>Lisa Rubin, who is observing the proceedings from the courtroom, said Engoron’s comment struck her as more light-hearted than contentious.</p><br><p>109d ago / 5:14 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>Team Trump attorney objects to AG office's line of questioning</h2><a href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60></a><p>As expected, we are now discussing Ivanka’s involvement in the bid for the Old Post Office lease, a process spearheaded by the General Services Administration.

matters, however, because the attorney general's office is working up to a point about Deutsche Bank: After a series of failed conversations with multiple other banks and private equity firms

As a result, she could not be liable for any transactions beyond 2014, the court ruled.</p><p>But it is a mistake to believe Ivanka’s testimony will be relevant only to the extent that she can implicate others. Rather, as a former officer of the Trump Org., her own complicity in the alleged fraud can be imputed to the corporate entities themselves during periods of time for which she herself can’t be liable. And her knowledge of and involvement in the valuation of certain assets and of the importance of her father’s statements of financial condition are more robust than most understand.</p><p>Show more</p><p>In particular, based on a review of filings in the case, I expect the attorney general’s office to elicit testimony from Ivanka about the following topics:</p><p><strong>Her Park Avenue residence: </strong>For years, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, leased two different penthouse apartments in a Trump-owned building; their leases also included options to purchase each&nbsp;apartment.</p><p>The problem? The purchase price listed in their leases was far below the estimated current value of the apartments in Trump’s statements of financial condition. Ivanka will almost certainly be asked about these discrepancies and whether she understood them at the time that she was also involved in forwarding her father’s statements of financial condition in connection with prospective deals and loans.</p><p><strong>Her relationship with Deutsche Bank:</strong> The Trump family’s relationship with the private wealth management side of Deutsche Bank, which repeatedly loaned Donald Trump money in connection with commercial transactions, infamously began with Kushner, who introduced the Trumps to Rosemary Vrablic, who recognized Ivanka as the intended heir to the family “empire.”</p><p>Thereafter, Ivanka was, according to the attorney general, the lead negotiator of and “the primary point of contact” with Deutsche Bank with respect to the Doral, Trump Chicago and Old Post Office loans. She will likely be asked today whether her dad’s statements of financial condition were, in fact, a critical part of inducing the bank to lend to her dad. (Donald Trump, for his part, insisted during his testimony, that all Deutsche Bank really cared about was the quality of the asset he was purchasing and his cash on hand, not his overall financial condition.)</p><p><strong>The Old Post Office deal: </strong>Ivanka, unlike her eldest brothers and father, never actually certified her father’s statements of financial condition. But she spearheaded the Trump Org.’s bid for a lease at Washington, D.C.’s Old Post Office, a government property managed by the General Services Administration where Trump ultimately opened the Trump International Hotel Washington DC.</p><p>In connection with that bidding process, Ivanka walked the GSA through Trump’s statements of financial condition, even detailing for the GSA the reasons for certain exceptions to GAAP, according to prosecutors. And Ivanka, like her dad, may be asked about the Trumps' exit from the Old Post Office lease too: Trump’s own testimony reflected that their net proceeds from the sale equaled roughly $139 million, including distributions of about $4 million to each adult child.</p><br><p>109d ago / 2:24 PM UTC</p><h2 class=styles_chartCardHeadline__aiJF0 data-testid=chat-card-headline>'Crime family' shouted at Ivanka as she arrives</h2><span class="byline-thumbnail byline-thumbnail--generic-thumbnail styles_bylineThumbnail___nR29"><a href=#></a></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60><p>Ivanka has entered the chat.</p><p>Some people outside the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan<a href=#> shouted "crime family"</a> as she arrived minutes ago.
