Sebastian Stan might be most known for his role as Bucky Barnes/ The Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But that hasn’t stopped fans from jones-ing to see him as another character in an even more famous franchise. Heck, with the studios being almost universally linked at this point, crossover performances from one franchise to another make quite a bit of sense these days."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But that hasn’t stopped fans from jones-ing to see him as another character in an even more famous franchise. Heck, with the studios being almost universally linked at this point, crossover performances from one franchise to another make quite a bit of sense these days. So is it any wonder that we already have some deep fakes of Stan playing a younger Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian? Check out the video below that gives a glimpse of just what this casting could have looked like.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Frankly, the resemblance between Sebastian Stan and a de-aged Mark Hamill is remarkable. If not put side-by-side for comparison’s sake, I’m not sure I would have been able to tell the difference between the two at first glance. With facial altering technology, it’s getting easier and easier to see how these possible castings would have worked, and this one appears like it could have been the real deal. Fans were already clamoring for <a href=#>Stan to play</a> the role and this video will likely only have those voices trumpeted louder.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t just fan-speak that put Sebastian Stan into a Mandalorian appearance as Luke Skywalker either. This had already made its rounds through the rumor mill that the actor would <a href=#>appear in a cameo</a> as the character some time in the show. So there’s also some additional context for why he’d be the specific choice among fans. And from what we could tell in the video, I’m not sure anyone would have even been the wiser if it had been him.</p><p>A technologically-altered and de-aged Mark Hamill (are we sure it wasn’t Sebastian Stan?) made the mic-dropping, appearance as <a href=#>Luke Skywalker</a> in The Mandalorian Season 2 Finale, “The Rescue”. It instantly sent the Star Wars world abuzz about what it meant for not only the show’s story arc, but the greater franchise universe as well. The build-up to the finale and the reveal led to the <a href=#>show’s best numbers</a> yet on the Disney+ platform.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-18-at-8.30.13-AM-900x465.png><p>And with news that the <a href=#>Luke Skywalker sighting</a> isn’t going to be a one-off, but rather a possible recurring character in The Mandalorian story, we could see this as the role Sebastian Stan inhabits going forward. Working with continuous CGI and de-aging technology does tend to be a little uncanny valley if there’s overexposure to the character. If Skywalker is going to have extended scenes then they are likely just better off recasting the character altogether, especially if fans are already into the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mandalorian’s Season 3 has no clear timetable to return, Sebastian Stan or not. In the meantime, we were treated to another story stemming from the show with word that The Book of Boba Fett would be hitting the streaming platform as a miniseries at the end of 2021. There’s still plenty of time for Star Wars stories, surprises, cameos, and much more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvSnpmaq6Serq950q2Yp2WemsRuuNSknGarm67EorjKnqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
