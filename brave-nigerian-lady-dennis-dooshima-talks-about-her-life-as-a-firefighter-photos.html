I’ve had some people criticize me for being a Nigerian female firefighter. I didn't have to use words to fight, I can prove my place in my field. I'm proud of what I do and where I come from, I became close with some great people that constantly encouraged me and told me not to give up! Every time I felt like leaving I’d think about how great it feels to get on and save lives. Even now, I know there are still some people that think I don’t belong here but overall I think I’ve shown how much I care and want to do this."</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>5) Do you get scared when you have to run into a build to save a life?</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>"I don't get scared but will want you to picture it when there's fire in a building or a fuel station everybody runs out but we firemen will go in, rescue and put out fire my dear it's not an easy something."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt71unt760r9s.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>6) How do you feel when you see burn victims?</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>"Generally nobody feels good about it but personally I feel pity & very sad about it, I wish they knew or had an idea 5 minutes before hand.

There will never be a better feeling than knowing you did your part in saving someone's life, possessions or home. Thanks to all of the fellow brothers and sisters for doing your part."</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>8) You celebrated your last birthday with burn victims at the hospital, what made you decide to do so?</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>"I chose to celebrate my last birthday differently because my birthday will not come with the same age again and I wanted to put a smile on someone else's face. I wanted to do humanitarian work which is also part of my job and help those who are in need. Their blessings are the best gift one could ever ask for. I took it up on my self the method of helping others step away from their stress was humor."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytblsdh4vfhv4.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>9) Do you get treated differently as a female firefighter?</strong><i></i></p><p class=align-left><i>"If yes, how does that make you feel?

The brotherhood that you can have with anyone in the fire service. Being able to talk to them and not have a clue who they are. Oh helping people is pretty cool, we take care of our own . It's a family that you are part of forever regardless. What I don't like are death notifications, anything with kids and dealing with mutts. Honestly, it's the quality friendship and doing the job when needed safely and going home. Having people say Thank you."</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>12) What is the key advice you can give Nigerians to avoid fire accidents?</strong></p><p class=align-left><i>"Many deaths and injuries can be prevented if people have a better understanding of fire."</i></p><p class=align-left>See more beautiful photos of Dennis Dooshima below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt349nrasgdnng.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt22c1ltdajupg.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt705tso4hb7n.jpg><p class=align-left>Meet female Nigerian taxi driver</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ8km5ra2WSp663sYynoKCdop6ur3nLmpuyZZSau6%2B10mabqKejnbaurYytmKWjo2K5qrLEZphmnpmnsqe1xqGrnqpdpbWwwM6sZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
