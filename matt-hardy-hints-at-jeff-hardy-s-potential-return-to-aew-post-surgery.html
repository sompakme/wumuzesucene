Jeff has been absent from AEW since June 2022,<a href=#> when he was arrested for DUI, and was suspended without pay until he completed substance abuse treatment</a>. The court case was recently closed, and it seems that Jeff’s return to AEW has not yet been discussed.</p><p>Matt was asked to provide an update on Jeff’s condition during the video, and he first highlighted Jeff’s growth and the way he has been working on himself. Matt then revealed that Jeff recently had eye surgery and shared his hope that, once Jeff recovers, fans could see him again in AEW.</p><p>“Jeff just had some eye surgery. His eyes were just a little off-set, it’s just probably from wear and tear and beating his body up. They had to work on some ligaments and tendons in one of his eyes. So they corrected that [with] surgery and they said probably in five, six weeks, he should be okay. So I’m hoping after that, now that he’s kind of putting this whole situation behind him, that we’ll see him back around soon. I’m hoping so, man. You guys keep your fingers crossed. Maybe six, eight weeks from now, hopefully we can see some Jeff Hardy on AEW.”</p><p>Jeff’s absence from AEW has been felt by many fans who were excited to see him in the company after his release from WWE in 2020. While it’s unclear when Jeff will return to the ring, it’s good to hear that he is taking care of his health and recovering from his eye surgery.</p><p>Fans will no doubt be eagerly awaiting any news of Jeff’s return to AEW and hoping to see him back in action soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on Jeff Hardy’s absence from AEW?
