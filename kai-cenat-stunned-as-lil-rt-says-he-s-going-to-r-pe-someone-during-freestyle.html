Overall, he has been able to work with the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a>, Rich Paul, and a whole host of others. However, he has also gotten to do streams with some lesser-known people. Furthermore, he will also work with some viral stars. Even if these viral personalities end up crashing out later on, Kai gets to bring them to his viewers for some fun content. In the end, it is a win-win.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Well, the streamer <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">decided to link up recently with Lil RT.</a> For those who are unaware, RT is a young child who went viral for a recent rap song. Overall, the song is vulgar and contains a whole bunch of subjects that a child should not rap about. Well, when RT was on Cenat's stream, he continued to act in a manner that was a bit too mature for his age. As you can see below, he even says that he is going to "r*pe" someone which is simply unacceptable. Kai was stunned and clearly did not what to do.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kai-cenat-x-lil-rt>Kai Cenat x Lil RT</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, fans were also very stunned by the behavior. After all, a kid shouldn't be saying those things. Hell, and adult shouldn't say it either. Consequently, some people believe that the adults in Lil RT's life are failing him right now. It is hard to disagree with something like that. At this point, an intervention might just be necessary. If not, then one can only imagine how things would evolve from here on out. Hopefully, he is taught some valuable lessons before it is ultimately too late.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We also hope that Cenat can be a positive role model of sorts.
