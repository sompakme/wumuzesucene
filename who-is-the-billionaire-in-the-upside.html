Phillip Lacasse is a French actor and director.
 
In light of this, who exactly is the actual Phillip from the other side? Bryan Cranston is an actor who has been in a number of films and television shows.

 And what is the real narrative behind the positive side of the coin? Kevin Hart joined the cast in 2014, and the movie that we have today started to take shape."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To put it another way, The Upside is a remake, at least from one perspective. Though it is a fictionalised account of real-life events, the film is based on the memoirs of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his life auxiliary, Abdel Sellou, who wrote the book The Intouchables.</p><p></p><h3>Simply put, who are the genuine characters on the other side of the coin?</h3><p>The film is based on the true storey of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou (whose names are changed in the film to Phillip Lacasse and Dell Scott, played by Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart, respectively), and it is an adaptation of the 2012 French film Les Intouchables, which was released in the United States.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What caused the person on the upside to become paralysed?</h3><p>He was involved in a paragliding accident. He had a broken spine, and the injuries he sustained rendered him a quadriplegic, which means that both his arms and legs were paralysed. Immediately after the tragedy, Philippe’s wife, Beatrice, made certain that he was well taken care of, but she died three years later after a lengthy struggle with cancer. The billionaire fell into a state of despair.</p><p></p><h3>There were 12 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>Is Untouchable a factual tale or a fictionalised version of it?</h3><p>“Untouchable” brazenly proclaims that it is based on a genuine tale, albeit it is worth noting that the real-life carer is Arab, not black. Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a very rich businessman, was involved in a paragliding accident some years ago and is unable to move from the neck down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is the narrative of the intouchables based on a genuine storey?</h3><p>The actual tale of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian carer Abdel Sellou, which was found by the filmmakers while making the documentary film la vie, à la death, served as the inspiration for the film’s narrative.</p><p></p><h3>How much money did the upside generate?</h3><p>Tickets are available at the box office. A total of $122.7 million was earned by The Upside internationally, against a production budget of $37.5 million. It earned $108.3 million in the United States and Canada and $14.5 million in other regions, for a total worldwide revenue of $122.7 million.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Was Abdel Sellou the one who started the company?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Sellou no longer lives in the Paris banlieues, but has established a company in Algeria, where he raises hens for sale. He’s also authored a book, which you can read here. According to him, “For someone who has never even read a book in his life, ‘You Changed My Life’ was like a 250-page thank you note,” he said of his best-selling book.</p><p></p><h3>What happened to Abdel Sellou?</h3><p>Abdel Sellou is now a farmer in Algeria, where he lives with his wife and three children and operates a poultry farm. Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who resides in Morocco with his second wife and two children, is someone to whom he stays close.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>In which location did the paragliding scene in Upside be filmed?</h3><p>A Pennsylvania hill had previously been utilised for the paragliding launch scenes, so Paul went on a search for Oregon locations that were more visually comparable to the Pennsylvania hill than the original option of Woodrat Mountain.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><h3>Is the movie the silver lining in Netflix’s otherwise bleak picture?</h3><p>The Upside (2019) is available to rent on DVD and Blu-ray via DVD Netflix.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is there a positive aspect to Amazon Prime?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>THE UPSIDE, a comedy-drama starring Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston, has been bought by Amazon Prime Video on an exclusive basis for all foreign SVOD rights.
