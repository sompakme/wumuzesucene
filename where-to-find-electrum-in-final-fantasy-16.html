You're welcome.</pre><h2>How To Get Electrum In Final Fantasy XVI (FF16)</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/rT6BEl_BxJ32BcJoUEzgeYyFPNUrIQnt0goJfN5arC4/rs:fill:951:535:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8wLkNoYWRfL0ZGWFZJL2VsZWN0cnVtX2xvY2F0aW9uL3NldmVyaWFuX2ZpbmFsX2ZhbnRhc3lfMTYuanBn alt=severian_final_fantasy_16 width=951 height=535 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>You can get Electrum in Final Fantasy 16 by <strong>defeating Severian, the Notorious Mark</strong>. That's because, as the item's in-game description suggests, the crafting material is sourced from the remains of Fallen automata. That being said, the next question is, where is Severian's location in FFXVI?</p><p>Valisthean prospectors have yet to locate a source of naturally occurring electrum, the only known samples coming from the remains of Fallen automata. This has led some to surmise that [Electrum] is not, in fact, naturally occurring at all, and rather a creation of the lost people.</p><h2>Where To Find Electrum Location In Final Fantasy XVI</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/MAyHJXhF5GtrMl_kZk0ESRzJcvEEdUjDC0Y3PqjUCrY/rs:fill:951:535:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8wLkNoYWRfL0ZGWFZJL2VsZWN0cnVtX2xvY2F0aW9uL2VsZWN0cnVtX2xvY2F0aW9uX2luX2ZpbmFsX2ZhbnRhc3lfMTYuanBn alt=electrum_location_in_final_fantasy_16 width=951 height=535 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Severian is located in the <strong>northern part of Sorrowise</strong> in the Imperial Province of Rosaria.
