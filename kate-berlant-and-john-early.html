They met in 2012, when a mutual friend booked them to perform on the same show, and have been inseparable ever since.

John has appeared on Search Party, 30 Rock and The After Party.</p><p>Their particular brand of comedy is surreal and a little unhinged. On stage, they veer between intense platonic love in one moment, and in others: seething contempt, thinly masked with backhanded compliments and probing questions. When they do sketches, it's equally unhinged, but usually surreal and a little unnerving.</p><p>Their newest project combines both of those practices into one very funny special. It's called Would It Kill You To Laugh, premiering this week on Peacock.</p><p>Here's the premise: John Early and Kate Berlant play fictionalized versions of themselves. Decades ago, their characters starred on a smash hit sitcom called "He's Gay, She's Half-Jewish." Shortly after the show wrapped, they had a very public falling out.</p><p>Between the sketches in Would It Kill You To Laugh, Kate and John reunite for an interview with journalist Meredith Vieira and it becomes clear that, y'know... it's been a while, but those old wounds haven't *completely* healed.</p><p>Kate and John talk with Jesse about how they met, how their partnership has evolved over the years and why they get joy out of playing bad people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7zRZ6arn19nfXN%2BjmltaGpjZH5yfJZqcGxuaGZ8rK3TnmSbnaKhrq%2FAjJqlnWWapLWvecSaqaWx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
