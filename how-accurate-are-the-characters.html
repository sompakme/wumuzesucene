Loosely based on the real-life visionary, the film shows how Barnum (<span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=2>Jackman</span>), a family man, turned his misfortune into a world of mystique and magic that would become the "Greatest Show on Earth." The release of the film seems timely after the Ringling Bros.

Although Barnum is widely known as a circus impresario, the promoter didn't get into the circus business until age 61. The real Barnum enjoyed a great deal of notoriety, dallying in Connecticut politics, the lottery business, housing, newspapers and even literature, penning The Art of Money Getting. Barnum first rose to prominence for displaying a series of curious oddities and attractions (often of questionable authenticity), including the "<span data-scayt_word=Feejee data-scaytid=12>Feejee</span> Mermaid," "General Tom Thumb" and <span data-scayt_word=Joice data-scaytid=13>Joice</span> Heth, who claimed to be the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington, at the Barnum American Museum and in traveling exhibits around the world. It was only after the Barnum American Museum burned down in 1868 that Barnum gathered a slew of his old performers to form P.T. Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan, and Circus in Brooklyn on April 10, 1871. Like his onscreen counterpart, Barnum had a flair for the dramatic, requesting an early obituary so that he could read it before his death on April 7, 1891.</p><p>In Showman, Hugh <span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=14>Jackman</span> plays the charismatic business mogul, who, after being laid off, serendipitously comes up with the idea of starting a circus to give his family the "life they deserve." The <span data-scayt_word=multihyphenate data-scaytid=15>multihyphenate</span> adds the role of circus ringmaster to his already diverse and impressive portfolio as Wolverine in X-Men, as Peter Allen in the musical&nbsp;The Boy From Oz and as Jean <span data-scayt_word=Valjean data-scaytid=16>Valjean</span> in Les Miserables. However, The Greatest Showman, a project he has been with since 2009, is his "passion piece." At this year's <span data-scayt_word=CinemaCon data-scaytid=18>CinemaCon</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=19>Jackman</span> said he hopes that Showman will be "a celebration of creativity and what is unique about each and every one of us." <span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=22>Jackman</span>, the star and producer of the film, wanted to do right by the man who he believes helped invent show business: "This is Barnum; you've got to be over the top!" <span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=23>Jackman</span> told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.5><h2>Charity (Hallett) Barnum, portrayed by Michelle Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the-greatest-showman-df-07341_r_rgb_copy_-_h_2017.jpg><p>At age 21, Charity <span data-scayt_word=Hallett data-scaytid=38>Hallett</span> Barnum, of Bethel, Connecticut, married Barnum, then 19, in the fall of 1829.&nbsp;They were married for 44 years, and together had four girls, three of whom survived to adulthood. In a book of recollections, Barnum recalls the day he married <span data-scayt_word=Hallett data-scaytid=78>Hallett</span>, saying he "became the husband of one of the best women in the world."</p><p>Barnum's wife is played by Michelle Williams in the big-screen musical. During the casting for Showman, the filmmakers were looking for a female lead who could sing and act alongside <span data-scayt_word=Jackman data-scaytid=3>Jackman</span>. They found this in Williams, who has shown off her chops in the Broadway revival of Blackbird, for which she was nominated for a Tony as best lead actress in a play, and in My Week With Marilyn,&nbsp;which&nbsp;earned her an Academy Award nomination for playing Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Jenny Lind, portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_greatest_showman_rebecca_ferguson_and_jenny_lind_-_one_time_use_only_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017_.jpg><p>Jenny Lind, otherwise known as "The Swedish Nightingale," was one of the most highly regarded opera singers of the <span data-scayt_word=19th data-scaytid=3>19th</span> century. The European opera star had started singing on tours at age 11 and was on the verge of retirement when Barnum, who had never heard her sing a single note, made an offer she couldn't refuse: a 150-date national tour at $1,000 per performance. Lind can thank Barnum for her American star status; he had orchestrated the "Lind Craze" before she even set foot on American soil, using his trademark gift of promotion including advertisements, paper dolls and ticket auctions, creating a fanfare that led to more than 30,000 people awaiting her steamship arrival into the New York Harbor. Lind was a sensation, blazing her way through America and netting Barnum close to a half-million dollars in 1850.</p><p>Rebecca Ferguson, also Swedish, was tapped in early September 2016 to play this role opposite&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word="Jackman's" data-scaytid=5>Jackman's</span> Barnum.

Born in Virginia in 1865, Jones began her career at age 1, exhibited in Barnum's museum as "The Infant Esau." After a short but successful stint in New York, Barnum soon offered Jones' parents a weekly contract that included a $150 weekly salary. While Jones spent much of her 36-year career with Barnum in his "Greatest Show on Earth," she also came to be known for her musical talents and gracious etiquette.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bearded Lady, played by Tony nominee <span data-scayt_word=Keala data-scaytid=2>Keala</span> Settle, takes the lead in what has become the anthem of the movie musical, "This Is Me."

Although born a healthy child, Stratton stopped growing at six months, having reached a height of 25 inches. Barnum, already famous for his exhibition of human oddities, discovered the extraordinarily tiny boy at 4 years old and immediately signed him on as an attraction for Barnum's New York Museum. Barnum soon christened Stratton General Tom Thumb, who eventually reached 39 inches, and trained him to sing, dance and imitate famous figures of the time. Clad in military regalia, Stratton traveled the world, performing for the likes of Queen Victoria, Abraham Lincoln and King Edward VII.</p><p>Stratton is played by 23-year-old Australian actor Sam Humphrey, who stands at 50 inches and previously had a role on the Australian soap <span data-scayt_word=Neighbours data-scaytid=2>Neighbours</span>.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>James Gordon Bennett, portrayed by Paul Sparks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_greatest_showman_paul_sparks_and_james_gordon_bennett_jr._-_one_time_use_only_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg><p>James Gordon Bennett, the founder, editor and publisher of the&nbsp;New York Herald, helped shape American journalism. The Scottish-born editor immigrated to the U.S. in 1819, eventually settling in New York City. On May 6, 1835, Bennett printed the first of his four-page penny paper that would become the&nbsp;New York Herald. Although the publication got its start in a cellar, it would later have the largest circulation of any newspaper in the world.
