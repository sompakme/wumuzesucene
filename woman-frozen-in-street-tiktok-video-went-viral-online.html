The video, which was posted on TikTok by a guest user @unknown1575489 on July 11, 2023, shows a blonde woman dressed in a black top and white pants standing still on a pavement somewhere in the United Kingdom. She remains motionless for several seconds before she resumes walking normally. The video has amassed over 5.3 million views and over 500,000 likes on TikTok, and has also been shared on other platforms such as YouTube and Reddit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_origin_of_the_Woman_Frozen_in_Street_TikTok_Video></span>What is the origin of the Woman Frozen in Street TikTok Video?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The video was originally recorded on Snapchat by an unidentified man who was across the street from the woman. He added an on-screen caption that read: “She was like that for a minute before.” He also narrated the video, saying: “Why is she frozen? Bruh, I’m trippin.” He sounded bewildered and amused by the woman’s behavior. He later uploaded the video to TikTok with the caption: “NPC caught lacking #npc #malfunction”. NPC stands for Non-Playable Character, a term used in video games to refer to characters that are controlled by the computer and have predetermined actions and responses. The term is also used as a slang to describe someone who behaves in a robotic or glitchy manner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_people_react_to_the_video></span>How did people react to the video?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The video sparked a lot of reactions online, ranging from humorous to outraged.
