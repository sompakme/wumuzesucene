For now, it remains an icon, and there is very little that can actually change that. Throughout the years, a lot of the trends have changed. However, fans have still gravitated towards this shoe as it contains a silhouette that can go with almost anything. Not to mention, numerous brands are always lending their aesthetic to the SB Dunk Low in the form of collaborations.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Throughout 2023, fans can expect a few&nbsp;Nike SB Dunk Low collaborations</a>&nbsp;to make their way to the market. The latest of them is the Born X Raised model which can be seen below. In fact, this colorway is called "One Block At A Time," and we think fans will enjoy these quite a bit. This is because Born X Raised delivers a unique aesthetic to this shoe that is well-represented in the official photos. The pair is now getting a new release date, but it's very soon.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-born-x-raised-x-nike-sb-dunk-low>Born X Raised x <a href=# class=text-word>Nike</a> SB Dunk Low</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Firstly, this sneaker has a white base to it. However, the toe box has a cool crosshair look as opposed to the usual breathability holes. Secondly, there are some gorgeous blue overlays here, with an iridescent&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Nike</a>&nbsp;swoosh to back it up. "One Black At A Time" is written across the toe box, while "On The Turf" is written inside of the tongue. All of these details come together nicely, and we think fans will enjoy them immensely.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-more-photos>More Photos</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kicks On Fire&nbsp;reports that the Nike SB Dunk Low x Born X Raised will be released on September 23rd.
