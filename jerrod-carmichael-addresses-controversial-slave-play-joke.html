One joke about the comedian and his white boyfriend, however, recently <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sparked outrage</a> among viewers. “My boyfriend, he makes me smarter, he makes me read. I have so many books. Realistically I’m not gonna read all those books. He knows that. But the fact that I bought them says I love you. They’re little monuments around my apartment just like ‘look at this book from Amazon that I’m never gonna read,'" he said on an episode of the show. “I sometimes joke to him that our relationship is like that of a slave and a master’s son&nbsp; — who, like, teaches me how to read by candlelight.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The controversial concept of race-based sexual slave play didn't sit right with many, prompting Carmichael to receive a great deal of backlash. According to him, however, people are taking things completely <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">out of context</a>. He addressed the public's reaction to the joke during his recent appearance on The Breakfast Club, clarifying that the joke wasn't actually about sex at all.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jerrod-carmichael-says-his-joke-was-taken-out-of-context>Jerrod Carmichael Says His Joke Was Taken Out Of Context</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“It made it seem like I was talking like I’m into some type of race, sexual slavery roleplay with my boyfriend, which is untrue. It’s so false," he said of the backlash. “It has nothing to do with my boyfriend, it has nothing to do with the sex that we have. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">It has nothing to do with sex.</a> It’s something people have been reporting on. It’s about my boyfriend reading so much, he makes me feel insecure about my level of reading.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Jerrod Carmichael's joke about his boyfriend? Do you think he deserves all the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">backlash</a> he's receiving online for it, or are viewers overreacting?
