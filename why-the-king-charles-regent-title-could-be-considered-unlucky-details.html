Despite being married to Catherine of Braganza, he had no legitimate children, and the throne was passed to his brother, James, following the King’s sudden death in 1685. His death was long suspected to be a result of poisoning, but it has since been claimed that it was more likely due to kidney failure.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_BtJ0Sc45gz data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Meghan Markle's mother Doria Ragland is the Duchess' double in archived wedding photos" class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle's mother Doria Ragland is the Duchess' double in archived wedding photos</a></strong></p><p id=enaVmdhIV83O data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="The Queen's top fashion moment remembered - and it was huge" class=hm-link href=#>The Queen's top fashion moment remembered - and it was huge</a></strong></p><p id=eFenprk-9b3h><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c05ae27411ae-bonnie-prince-charlie-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=e-2hcGB896JE data-wc=9><strong>Bonnie Prince Charlie hoped to take the British throne</strong></p><p id=ehHLr-tYQCKq data-wc=50>The Bonnie Prince Charlie, a Stuart claimant to the throne, was also known to those who supported his claim as Charles III.
