"Don't no HOE run in my blood, my momma blood run all through me like she damn near made me herself! Torence just a sperm donor that AINT MY FATHER. DONT ACT LIKE 1 NEVER DID, ONLY ACTED LIKE 1 when he knew props was going to be given OR just for social media! ole social media loving ass.

"ppl want to see you down" whoot the whoot, nun that phase me because ok yes I'm mad because that was my car BUT ITS THE FACT N***A POSED TO BE A FATHER! BUT N***A NEVER HAD A FATHER TO BE ONE SO IG I UNDERSTAND. BUT STILL don't front on social media or to ppl like you the father of the year cause you not! It's n***as with NO MONEY AND A BETTER FATHER THAN YOU." Tori also noted that on some level she expected this to happen as Boosie reportedly kept the car in his name when he gave it to her. She claimed that her older siblings had received cars in their mother's name.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmboJ4hZNmmaino56ybrDArp6hrJWneqSt0Wapmqak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
